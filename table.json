Ion permeation occurs by ion-ion contacts in single file fashion through the selectivity filter (K\u00f6pfer et al. 2014). A narrow pore lined with four arrays of carbonyl groups is responsible for ion selectivity, whereas a conformational change of the four inner transmembrane helices (TMS2) is involved in gating (Baker et al. 2007). Two gates have been identified; one is located at the inner bundle crossing and is activated by H+ while the second gate is in the selectivity filter (Rauh et al. 2017). The C-terminal domain mediates pH modulation (Hirano et al., 2011;\u00a0Pau et al., 2007). KcsA exhibits a global twisting motion upon gating (Shimizu et al., 2008). Activity is influenced by the phase of the lipid bilayer (Seeger et al. 2010), and occupancy of nonannular lipid binding sites increases the stability of the tetrameric complex (Triano et al. 2010). The open conformation of KcsA can disturb the bilayer integrity and catalyze the flipping of phospholipids (Nakao et al. 2014). This protein is identical to the KcsA orthologue (P0A333) in Streptomyces coelicolor. The stability of the pre domain in KcsA is stabilized by GCN4 (Yuchi et al. 2008). The potential role of pore hydration in channel gating has been evaluated (Blasic et al. 2015). Having multiple K+ ions bound simultaneously is required for selective K+ conduction, and a reduction in the number of bound K+ ions destroys the multi-ion selectivity mechanism utilized by K+ channels (Medovoy et al. 2016). The channel accomodates K+ and H2O molecules alternately in a K+-H2O-K+-H2O series through the channel (Kratochvil et al. 2016). Insertion of KcsA is spontaneous and directional as the cytosolic part of the protein does not translocate across the membrane barrier. Charged residues, not hydrophobic residues, are crucial for insertion of the unfolded protein into the membrane via electrostatic interactions between membrane and protein. A two-step mechanism was proposed. An initial electrostatic attraction between membrane and protein represents the first step prior to insertion of hydrophobic residues into the hydrocarbon core of the membrane (Altrichter et al. 2016). Bend, splay, and twist distinguish KcsA gate opening, filter opening, and filter-gate coupling, respectively (Mitchell and Leibler 2017). Details of the water permeability have been presented. Water flow through KcsA is halved by 200 mM K+ in the aqueous solution, which indicates an effective K+ dissociation constant in that range for a singly occupied channel. (Hoomann et al. 2013). A parameterized MARTINI program can be used to predict the hinging motions of the protein (Li et al. 2019). Activation of KcsA is initiated by proton binding to the pH gate upon an intracellular drop in pH which prompts a conformational switch, leading to a loss of affinity for potassium ions at the selectivity filter and therefore to channel inactivation (Rivera-Torres et al. 2016). An alteration in the conformational equilibrium of the intracellular K+-gate is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the dysfunctions of K+ channels caused by disease-related mutations (Iwahashi et al. 2020). Folding and misfolding of KcsA monomers during assembly and tetramerization has been examined (Song et al. 2021). The flexible C-terminus stabilizes KcsA tetramers at a neutral pH with decreased stabilization at acidic pH (Howarth and McDermott 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1BL8  PBDID: 1F6G  PBDID: 1J95  PBDID: 1JQ1  PBDID: 1JQ2  PBDID: 1JVM  PBDID: 1K4C  PBDID: 1K4D  PBDID: 1R3I  PBDID: 1R3J  PBDID: 1R3K  PBDID: 1R3L  PBDID: 1S33  PBDID: 1ZWI  PBDID: 2A9H  PBDID: 2ATK  PBDID: 2BOB  PBDID: 2BOC  PBDID: 2DWD  PBDID: 2DWE  PBDID: 2H8P  PBDID: 2HG5  PBDID: 2HJF  PBDID: 2HVJ  PBDID: 2HVK  PBDID: 2IH1  PBDID: 2IH3  PBDID: 2ITC  PBDID: 2ITD  PBDID: 2JK5  PBDID: 2NLJ  PBDID: 2P7T  PBDID: 2QTO  PBDID: 2W0F  PBDID: 3EFF  PBDID: 3GB7  PBDID: 3IFX  PBDID: 3IGA  PBDID: 1S5H  PBDID: 3F5W  PBDID: 3F7V  PBDID: 3F7Y  PBDID: 3FB5  PBDID: 3FB6  PBDID: 3FB7  PBDID: 3FB8  PBDID: 3HPL  PBDID: 3OGC  PBDID: 3OR6  PBDID: 3OR7  PBDID: 3PJS  PBDID: 3STL  PBDID: 3STZ  PBDID: 4LBE  PBDID: 4LCU  PBDID: 4MSW  PBDID: 4UUJ  PBDID: 5e1a  PBDID: 5ebl  PBDID: 5ebw  PBDID: 5ec1  PBDID: 5ec2  PBDID: 5j9p  PBDID: 5EBM  PBDID: 5VK6  PBDID: 5VKE  PBDID: 5VKH  PBDID: 6NFU  PBDID: 6NFV  PBDID: 6PA0  PBDID: 6W0A  PBDID: 6W0B  PBDID: 6W0C  PBDID: 6W0D  PBDID: 6W0E  PBDID: 6W0F  PBDID: 6W0G  PBDID: 6W0H  PBDID: 6W0I  PBDID: 6W0J"},{"0":"1.A.1.10.1","1":"Voltage-sensitive Na+ channel, NaV1.7 (Cox et al., 2006). The human orthologue, SCN3A or Nav1.3, when mutated causes cryptogenic pediatric partial epilepsy (Holland et al., 2008; Zaman et al. 2020). Batrachotoxin (BTX) is a steroidal alkaloid neurotoxin that activates NaV channels through interacting with transmembrane domain-I-segment 6 (IS6) of these channels. Ginsenoside inhibits BTX binding (Lee et al. 2008). VGSCs are heterotrimeric complexes consisting of a single pore-forming alpha subunit joined by two beta subunits, a noncovalently linked beta1 or beta3 and a covalently linked beta2 or beta4 subunit (Hull and Isom 2017). The binding mode and functional components of the analgesic-antitumour peptide from Buthus martensii Karsch to human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 have been characterized (Zhao et al. 2019). Dvorak et al. 2021 developed allosteric modulators of ion channels by targeting their PPI interfaces, particularly in the C-terminal domain of the Nav, with auxiliary proteins. Fenestrations are key functional regions of Nav that modulate drug binding, lipid binding, and influence gating behaviors (Gamal El-Din and Lenaeus 2022). Compartment-specific localizations and trafficking mechanisms for VGSCs are regulated separately to modulate membrane excitability in the brain (Liu et al. 2022). Naview is a library for drawing and annotating voltage-gated sodium channel membrane diagrams (Afonso et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1QG9"},{"0":"1.A.1.10.12","1":"Type 2 Na+ channel, SCN2A or NaV1.2, of 2,005 aas and 24 TMSs. Mutations give rise to epileptic encephalophathy, Ohtahara syndrome (Nakamura et al. 2013). They may also give rise to autism (ASD) (Tavassoli et al. 2014). This protein is orthologous to the rat Na+ channel, TC# 1.A.1.10.1 and very similar to the type 1 Na+ channel (1.A.1.10.7). NaV1.2 has a single pore-forming alpha-subunit and two transmembrane beta-subunits. Expressed primarily in the brain, NaV1.2 is critical for initiation and propagation of action potentials. Milliseconds after the pore opens, sodium influx is terminated by inactivation processes mediated by regulatory proteins including calmodulin (CaM). Both calcium-free (apo) CaM and calcium-saturated CaM bind tightly to an IQ motif in the C-terminal tail of the alpha-subunit. Thermodynamic studies and solution structure (2KXW) of a C-domain fragment of apo 13C,15N- CaM (CaMC) bound to an unlabeled peptide with the sequence of the rat NaV1.2 IQ motif showed that apo CaMC (a) was necessary and sufficient for binding, and (b) bound more favorably than calcium-saturated CaMC. CaMN apparently does not influence apo CaM binding to NaV1.2IQp (Mahling et al. 2017). The phenotypic spectrum of SCN2A-related epilepsy is broad, ranging from benign epilepsy in neonate and infancy to severe epileptic encephalopathy. Oxcarbazepine and valproate are the most effective drugs in epilepsy patients with SCN2A variants. Sodium channel blockers often worsen seizures in patients with seizure onset beyond 1 year of age. Abnormal brain MRI findings and de novo variations are often related to poor prognosis. Most SCN2A variants located in transmembrane regions were related to patients with developmental delay (Zeng et al. 2022). The beta4-subunit and PRRT2 form a push-pull system that finely tunes the membrane expression and function of NaV channels and the intrinsic neuronal excitability (Valente et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2KAV  PBDID: 4JPZ  PBDID: 4RLY  PBDID: 6BUT  PBDID: 6J8E"},{"0":"1.A.1.10.19","1":"Sodium channel Nav1.4-beta complex of 1820 and 209 aas, respectively.

The immunoglobulin domain of beta1 docks onto the extracellular L5I and L6IV loops of EeNav1.4 via extensive polar interactions, and the single transmembrane helix interacts with the third voltage-sensing domain (VSDIII). The VSDs exhibit \"\"up\"\" conformations, while the intracellular gate of the pore domain is kept open by a digitonin-like molecule. Structural comparison with closed NavPaS shows that the outward transfer of gating charges is coupled to the iris-like pore domain dilation through intricate force transmissions involving multiple channel segments. The IFM fast inactivation motif on the III-IV linker is plugged into the corner enclosed by the outer S4-S5 and inner S6 segments in repeats III and IV, suggesting a potential allosteric blocking mechanism for fast inactivation (Yan et al. 2017). The PDB# for the complex is 5XSY, and that for the two subunits are 5XSY_A and 5XSY_B.

The COOH terminus functions in the control of channel inactivation and in pathologies caused by inherited mutations that disrupt it (Glaaser et al., 2006); regulated by ProTx-II Toxin (Smith et al. 2007), telethonin, the titin cap protein (167aas; secreted protein; O15273) (Mazzone et al., 2008), and the Mog1 protein, a central component of the channel complex (Wu et al., 2008). Nav1.5, the principal Na+ channel in the heart, possesses an ankyrin binding site, and direct interaction with ankyrin-G is required for the expression of Nav1.5 at the cardiomyocyte cell surface (Bennett and Healy, 2008; Lowe et al., 2008). Mutations cause type 3 long QT syndrome and type 1 Brugada syndrome, two distinct heritable arrhythmia syndromes (Mazzone et al., 2008; Kapplinger et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2015).\u00a0SCN5A mutations causing arrhythmic dilated cardiomyopathy, commonly localized to the voltage-sensing mechanism, and giving rise to gating pore currents (currents that go through the voltage sensor) have been identified (McNair et al., 2011; Moreau et al., 2014). Patients with Brugada syndrome are prone to develop ventricular tachyarrhythmias that may lead to syncope, cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death (Sheikh and Ranjan 2014) and (Kapplinger et al. 2015). Mutations causing disease have been identified (Qureshi et al. 2015). These give rise to arrhythias and cardiomyopathies (Moreau et al. 2015). Mutations that cause relative resistance to slow inactivation have been identified (Chancey et al. 2007). Green tea catechins are potential anti-arrhythmics because of the significant effect of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (E3G) on cardiac sodium channelopathies that display a hyperexcitability phenotype (Boukhabza et al. 2016). A mutatioin, R367G, causes the familial cardiac conductioin disease (Yu et al. 2017). The C-terminal domain of calmodulin (CaM) binds to an IQ motif in the C-terminal tail of the alpha-subunit of all NaV isoforms, and contributes to calcium-dependent pore-gating in some (Isbell et al. 2018). Ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) is often initiated by premature ventricular contractions, and the presence of SCN5A mutations increases the risk upon exposure to sodium channel blockers in patients with or without baseline type-1 ECG (Amin et al. 2018). A mutation (R367G) is associated with familial cardiac conduction disease (Yu et al. 2017). Among ranolazine, flecainide, and mexiletine, only mexiletine restored inactivation kinetics of the currents of the mutant protein, A1656D (Kim et al. 2019). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is protective against cardiovascular disorders due in part to its action on multiple molecular pathways and transmembrane proteins, including the cardiac Nav1.5 channels (Amarouch et al. 2020). An SCN1B variant affects both cardiac-type (NaV1.5) and brain-type (NaV1.1) sodium currents and contributes to complex concomitant brain and cardiac disorders (Martinez-Moreno et al. 2020). Mice null for Scn1b, which encodes NaV beta1 and beta1b subunits, have defects in neuronal development and excitability, spontaneous generalized seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and early mortality (Martinez-Moreno et al., 2020; Martinez-Moreno et al. 2020). The structural basis of cytoplasmic NaV1.5 and NaV1.4 regulation has been reviewed (Nathan et al. 2021). Fibroblast growth factor 21 ameliorates NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 channel dysregulation in human AC16 cardiomyocytes (Li et al. 2021). The interaction of Nav1.5 with MOG1 (RANGRF), a Ran guanine nucleotide release factor and chaparone, provides a possible molecular mechanism for Brugada syndrome (Xiong et al. 2021). Arrhythmic phenotypes are a defining feature of dilated cardiomyopathy-associated SCN5A variants (Peters et al. 2021). A SCN5A genetic variant, Y739D, is associated with Brugada syndrome (Zaytseva et al. 2022). Melatonin treatment causes an increase of conduction via enhancement of sodium channel protein expression and increases of sodium current in the ventricular myocytes (Durkina et al. 2022). Quantification of Nav1.5 expression has been published (Adams et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2KBI  PBDID: 2L53  PBDID: 4DCK  PBDID: 4DJC  PBDID: 4JQ0  PBDID: 4OVN  PBDID: 5DBR  PBDID: 6MUD"},{"0":"1.A.1.10.4","1":"The skeletal muscle Na+ channel, NaV1.4 of 1836 aas and 24 TMSs.

Also causes myotonia; regulated by calmodulin which binds to the C-terminus of Nav1.4 (Biswas et al., 2008). NaV1.4 gating pores are permeable to guanidine as well as Na+ and H+ (Sokolov et al., 2010). The R669H mutation allows transmembrane permeation of protons, but not larger cations, similar to the conductance displayed by histidine substitution at Shaker K+ channel S4 sites (Struyk and Cannon 2007). The mechanism of inactivation involves transient interactions between intracellular domains resulting in direct pore occlusion by the IFM motif and concomitant extracellular interactions with the beta1 subunit (S\u00e1nchez-Solano et al. 2016). Potassium-sensitive hypokalaemic and normokalaemic periodic paralysis are inherited skeletal muscle diseases in humans, characterized by episodes of flaccid muscle weakness. They are caused by single mutations in positively charged residues ('gating charges') in the S4 transmembrane segment of the voltage sensor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4 or the calcium channel Cav1.1. Mutations of the outermost gating charges (R1 and R2) cause hypokalaemic periodic paralysis by creating a pathogenic gating pore in the voltage sensor through which cations leak in the resting state. Mutations of the third gating charge (R3) cause normokalaemic periodic paralysis owing to cation leak in both activated and inactivated states (Jiang et al. 2018). The neurotoxic cone snail peptide \u03bc-GIIIA specifically blocks skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium (NaV1.4) channels (Leipold et al. 2017). the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human Nav1.4-\u03b21  complex at 3.2-\u00c5 resolution. Accurate model building was made for the pore domain, the voltage-sensing domains, and the \u03b21 subunit (Pan et al. 2018) provided insight into the molecular basis for Na+ permeation and kinetic asymmetry of the four repeats. Structural analysis of reported functional residues and disease mutations corroborates an allosteric blocking mechanism for fast inactivation of Nav channels. the S4-S5L of the DI, DII and DIII domains allosterically modulate the activation gate and stabilize its open state (Malak et al. 2020).

An S241T mutation causes inherited erythromelalgia IEM; erythermalgia, an autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by burning pain in the extremities in response to mild warmth (due to altered gating) (Lampert et al., 2006; Drenth and Waxman, 2007).

Ca2+ binding to the cytosolic EF-hand domain triggers conformational changes coupled to the pair of pore-lining inner helices from the first 6-TMS domains, whereas membrane potential only activates the second voltage-sensing domain, the conformational changes of which are coupled to the pair of inner helices from the second 6-TMS domains. Luminal Ca2+ or Ba2+ modulates voltage activation by stabilizing the second voltage-sensing domain in the resting state and shift voltage activation towards more positive potentials. The basis for understanding ion permeation, channel activation, the location of voltage-sensing domains and regulatory ion-binding sites is partially explained by the 3-d structure (Kintzer and Stroud 2016).

These structures, in concert with patch-clamp electrophysiology, showed that residues in the pore mouth sense inhibitory Ca2+ and are allosterically coupled to the voltage sensor. These conformational changes provide insight into the mechanism of voltage-sensor domain activation in which activation occurs vectorially over a series of elementary steps (Dickinson et al. 2022).

A gain of function mutation gave symptoms of congenital ataxia, abnormal eye movements and developmental delay with severe attacks of hemiplegic migraine (Garc\u00eda Segarra et al. 2014). Mutations can cause F\/SHM with high penitrance (Prontera et al. 2018).

The variants are either gain of function GOF) or loss of function (LOF) mutations (Zhang et al. 2020). CACNA1A pathogenic variants have been linked to several neurological disorders including severe early onset developmental encephalopathies and cerebellar atrophy. Y1384 variants exhibit differential splice variant-specific effects on recovery from inactivation (Gandini et al. 2021). Patients with CACNA1A mutational variants located in the transmembrane region may be at high risk of status epilepticus (Niu et al. 2022). Patients with ataxia in the absence of epilepsy can be caused by a CACNA1A mutationand respond to pyridoxine (Du et al. 2017). lamotrigine can be used to treat patients with refractory epilepsy due to calcium channel mutations (Hu et al. 2022; De Romanis and Sopranzi 2018). Eupatilin depresses glutamate exocytosis from cerebrocortical synaptosomes by decreasing P\/Q-type Ca2+ channels and synapsin I phosphorylation and alleviates glutamate excitotoxicity caused by kainic acid by preventing glutamatergic alterations in the mamalian cortex.

Calcium channels containing the alpha-1S subunit play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle via their interaction with RYR1, which triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcplasmic reticulum and ultimately results in muscle contraction.

C-type inactivation may involve movements of transmembrane voltage sensor domains. In the absence of Ca2+, a single structure in a closed state was observed by cryoEM that was highly flexible with large rocking motions of the gating ring and bending of pore-lining helices (Fan et al. 2020). In Ca2+-bound conditions, several open-inactivated conformations were present with the different channel conformations being distinguished by rocking of the gating rings with respect to the transmembrane region. In all conformations displaying open channel pores, the N-terminus of one subunit of the channel tetramer sticks into the pore and plugs it. Deletion of this N terminus led to non-inactivating channels with structures of open states without a pore plug, indicating that this N-terminal peptide is responsible for a ball-and-chain inactivation mechanism (Fan et al. 2020). Lipid-protein interactions influence the conformational equilibrium between two states of the channel that differ according to whether a TMS has a kink. Two key residues in the kink region mediate crosstalk between two gates at the selectivity filter and the central cavity, respectively.

Residues involved in gating have been identified (Garneau et al. 2014). It is also present in the inner mitochondrial membrane where increases of mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] cause mtKCa3.1 opening, thus linking inner membrane K+ permeability and transmembrane potential to Ca2+ signalling (De Marchi et al. 2009). KCa3.1 (IKCa) channels are expressed in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells and contribute to the slow afterhyperpolarization that regulates spike accommodation (Turner et al. 2016). SK channel activators can compensate for age-related changes of the autorhythmic functions of the cerebellum (Karelina et al. 2017). The activation mechanism has been revealed by the cryoEM structure of the SK4-calmodulin complex (Lee and MacKinnon 2018). It is responsible for hyperpolarization in some tumor cells (Lazzari-Dean et al. 2019). Mutations are linked to dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (xerocytosis) (Andolfo et al. 2015). This channel is present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019). KCNN4 promotes the progression of lung adenocarcinoma by activating the AKT and ERK signaling pathways (Xu et al. 2021). KCa3.1 channels in human microglia link extracellular ATP-evoked Ca2+ transients to changes in membrane conductance with an inflammation-dependent mechanism, and suggests that during brain inflammation, the KCa3.1-mediated microglial response to purinergic signaling may be reduced (Palomba et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 6CNM  PBDID: 6CNN  PBDID: 6CNO  PBDID: 6D42"},{"0":"1.A.1.17.1","1":"The archaeal voltage-regulated K channel, KvAP (Ruta et al., 2003). X-ray and solution structures are available. The latter shows phospholipid interactions with the isolated voltage sensor domain (Butterwick and MacKinnon 2010; Li et al. 2014). The gating-charge arginine in TMS4 of the voltage sensor forms part of the helical hairpin \"paddle\", and it moves 15-20 \u00c5 through the membrane to open the pore (Ruta et al., 2005). The orientation and depth of insertion of the voltage-sensing S4 helix has been determined (Doherty et al., 2010).\u00a0A synthetic S6 segment derived from the KvAP channel self-assembles, permeabilizes lipid vesicles, and exhibits ion channel activity in bilayer lipid membrane (Verma et al., 2011). Thus the gating mechanism combines structural rearrangements and electric-field remodeling ( Li et al. 2014). KvAP has been reconstituted in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) (Garten et al. 2015). TMS4 (S4) which senses voltage also promotes membrane insertion of the voltage-sensor domain (Mishima et al. 2016). KvAP has a configuration consistent with a water channel, possibly underlying the conductance of protons, and other cations, through voltage-sensor domains (Freites et al. 2006). The structural dynamics of the paddle motif loop in the activated conformation of the KvAP voltage sensor have been studied from biophysical standpoints (Das et al. 2019). The S4 alpha-helix, which is straight in the experimental crystal structure solved under depolarized conditions (Vm approximately 0), breaks into two segments when the cell membrane is hyperpolarized (Vm << 0) and reversibly forms a single straight helix following depolarization (Vm = 0) ((Bignucolo and Bern\u00e8che 2020). The outermost segment of S4 translates along the normal to the membrane, bringing new perspective to previously paradoxical accessibility experiments that were initially thought to imply the displacement of the whole VSD across the membrane. The breakage of S4 under (hyper)polarization could be a general feature of Kv channels with a non-swapped topology. The surface charge of the membrane does not significantly affect the topology and structural dynamics of the sensor loop in membranes (Das and Raghuraman 2021). The dynamic variability of the sensor loop is preserved in both zwitterionic (POPC) and anionic (POPC\/POPG) lipid membranes. The lifetime distribution analysis for the NBD-labelled residues by the maximum entropy method (MEM) demonstrates that, in contrast to micelles, the membrane environment not only reduces the relative discrete population of sensor loop conformations, but also broadens the lifetime distribution peaks. The local curvature of cellular membranes acts as a driving force for the targeting of membrane-associated proteins to specific membrane domains, as well as a sorting mechanism for transmembrane proteins, as demonstrated for KvAP (Kluge et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1ORQ  PBDID: 1ORS  PBDID: 2A0L  PBDID: 2KYH  PBDID: 6UWM"},{"0":"1.A.1.17.2","1":"Voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv (Santos et al., 2008).","2":"PBDID: 4H33  PBDID: 4H37"},{"0":"1.A.1.2.10","1":"Voltage-gated K+ channel, chain A, Shaker-related, Kv1.2 or KCNA2 (Crystal structure known, Long et al., 2007; Chen et al. 2010).

The Sigma 1 receptor (Q99720; Sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1) interacts with Kv1.2 to shape neuronal and behavioral responses to cocaine (Kourrich et al. 2013). Amino acid substitutions cause Shaker to become heat-sensing (opens with increasing temperature as for TrpV1) or cold-sensing (opens with decreasing temperature as for TrpM8) (Chowdhury et al. 2014). The Shaker Kv channel was truncated after the 4th transmembrane helix S4 (Shaker-iVSD) which showed altered gating kinetics and formed a cation-selective ion channel with a strong preference for protons (Zhao and Blunck 2016). Direct axon-to-myelin linkage by abundant KV1\/Cx29 (TC# 1.A.24.1.12) channel interactions in rodent axons supports the idea of an electrically active  role for myelin in increasing both the saltatory conduction velocity and the maximal propagation frequency in mammalian myelinated axons (Rash et al. 2016). A cryoEM structure (3 - 4 \u00c5 resolution; paddle chimeric channel; closed form) in nanodiscs has been determined (Matthies et al. 2018). Possible gating mechanisms have been discussed (Kariev and Green 2018; Infield et al. 2018). Pathogenic variants in KCNA2, encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2, have been identified as the cause for an evolving spectrum of neurological disorders. Affected individuals show early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, and movement disorders resulting from cerebellar dysfunction (D\u00f6ring et al. 2021). In addition, individuals with a milder course of epilepsy, complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia, and episodic ataxia have been reported. Biophysical properties of a delayed rectifier K+ current can contribute to its role ingenerating spontaneous myogenic activity (Hu et al. 2021). The local curvature of cellular membranes acts as a driving force for the targeting of membrane-associated proteins to specific membrane domains, as well as a sorting mechanism for transmembrane proteins, as demonstrated for the chimeric channel, Kv1.2\/2.1; KvChim induces a strong positive membrane curvature (Kluge et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 3lut"},{"0":"1.A.1.2.12","1":"Voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.1 or KCNA1.

Defects cause episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), an autosomal dominant K+ channelopathy accompanied by short attacks of cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria (D'Adamo et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2020). Direct axon-to-myelin linkage by abundant KV1\/Cx29 channel interactions in rodent axons supports the idea of an electrically active  role for myelin in increasing both the saltatory conduction velocity and the maximal propagation frequency in mammalian myelinated axons (Rash et al. 2016). Kv1.1 is present in bull sperm where it is necessary for normal sperm progressive motility, per cent capacitated spermatozoa (B-pattern) and the acrosome reaction (Gupta et al. 2018). Gating induces large aqueous volumetric remodeling (D\u00edaz-Franulic et al. 2018). Paulhus et al. 2020 have reviewed the pathology of mutants in this protein and showed that epilepsy or seizure-related variants tend to cluster in the S1\/S2 transmembrane domains and in the pore region of Kv1.1, whereas EA1-associated variants occur along the whole length of the protein, but variants at the C-terminus are more likely to suffer from seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders (Yuan et al. 2020). Mutation in KCNA1 has been identified that impairs voltage sensitivity (Imbrici et al. 2021).

Kv1.3 associates with the sequence similar (>80%) Kv1.5 protein in macrophage forming heteromers that like Kv1.3 homomers are r-margatoxin sensitive (Vicente et al., 2006). However, the heteromers have different biophysical and pharmacological properties. The Kv1.3 mitochondrial potassium channel is involved in apoptotic signalling in lymphocytes (Gulbins et al., 2010). Interactions between the C-terminus of Kv1.5 and Kv\u03b2 regulate pyridine nucleotide-dependent changes in channel gating (Tipparaju et al., 2012). Intracellular trafficking of the KV1.3 K+ channel is regulated by the pro-domain of a matrix metalloprotease (Nguyen et al. 2013). Direct binding of caveolin regulates Kv1 channels and allows association with lipid rafts (P\u00e9rez-Verdaguer et al. 2016). Addtionally, NavBeta1 interacts with the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of Kv1.3 through W172 in the transmembrane segment to modify the gating process (Kubota et al. 2017). During insertion of Kv1.3, the extended N-terminus of the second\u00a0\u03b1-helix, S2, inside the ribosomal tunnel is converted into a helix in a transition that depends on the nascent peptide sequence at specific tunnel locations (Tu and Deutsch 2017). The microRNA, mmumiR449a, reduced the mRNA expression levels of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1), and calcium activated potassium channel subunit alpha1 (KCNMA1) and increased the level of transmembrane phosphatase with tension homology (TPTE) in the DRG cells (Lu et al. 2017). This channel is regulation by sterols (Balajthy et al. 2017). Loss of function causes atrial fibrillation, a rhythm disorder characterized by chaotic electrical activity of cardiac atria (Olson et al. 2006). The N-terminus and S1 of Kv1.5 can attract and coassemble with the rest of the channel (i.e. Frag(304-613)) to form a functional channel independently of the S1-S2 linkage (Lamothe et al. 2018). This channel may be present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019). Kv1.3 plays an essential role in the immune response mediated by leukocytes and is functional at both the plasma membrane and the inner mitochondrial membrane. Plasma membrane Kv1.3 mediates cellular activation and proliferation, whereas mitochondrial Kv1.3 participates in cell survival and apoptosis (Capera et al. 2022). Kv1.3 uses the TIM23 complex to translocate to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This mechanism is unconventional because the channel is a multimembrane spanning protein without a defined N-terminal presequence. Transmembrane domains cooperatively mediate Kv1.3 mitochondrial targeting involving the cytosolic HSP70\/HSP90 chaperone complex as a key regulator of the process (Capera et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 4BGC"},{"0":"1.A.1.2.6","1":"Voltage-gated K+ channel, Shaker.

Shaker K+ channels can be mutated in S4 to create an analogous \"omega\" pore (Held et al. 2018). The NMR structure of the isolated Shaker voltage-sensing domain in LPPG micelles has been reported (Chen et al. 2019). Substituting the first S4 arginine with a smaller amino acid opens a high-conductance pathway for solution cations in the Shaker K+ channel at rest. The cationic current does not flow through the central K+ pore and is influenced by mutation of a conserved residue in S2, suggesting that it flows through a protein pathway within the voltage-sensing domain (Tombola et al. 2005). The current can be carried by guanidinium ions, suggesting that this is the pathway for transmembrane arginine permeation. Tombola et al. 2005 proposed that when S4 moves, it ratchets between conformations in which one arginine after another occupies and occludes to ions in the narrowest part of this pathway.

Selective expression of HERG and Kv2 channels influences proliferation of uterine cancer cells (Suzuki and Takimoto 2004). H-ERG forms a heteromeric K+ channel regulating cardiac repolarization, neuronal firing frequency and neoplastic cell growth (Szab\u00f3 et al., 2011). Oligomerization is due to N-terminal interactions between two splice variants, hERG1a and hERG1b (Phartiyal et al., 2007). Structure function relationships of ERG channel activation and inhibition have been reviewed (Durdagi et al., 2010). Interactions between the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane core modulate hERG K channel gating (Fern\u00e1ndez-Trillo et al., 2011). The marine algal toxin azaspiracid is an open state blocker (Twiner et al., 2012). Verapamil blocks channel activity by binding to Y652 and F656 in TMS S6 (Duan et al. 2007). Hydrophobic interactions between the voltage sensor and the channel domain mediate inactivation (Perry et al. 2013), but voltage sensing by the S4 segment can be transduced to the channel gate in the absence of physical continuity between the two modules (L\u00f6rinczi et al. 2015). Mutations give rise to long QT syndrome (Osterbur et al. 2015). Polyphenols such as caffeic acid, phenylethyl ester (CAPE) and curcumin inhibit by modification of gating, not by blocking the pore (Choi et al. 2013). Potassium ions can inhibit tumorigenesis through inducing apoptosis of hepatoma cells by upregulating potassium ion transport channel proteins HERG and VDAC1 (Xia et al. 2016). Incorrectly folded hERG can be degraded by Bag1-stimulated Trc-8-dependent proteolysis (Hantouche et al. 2016). The S1 helix regulates channel activity. Thus, S1 region mutations reduce both the action potential repolarizing current passed by Kv11.1 channels in cardiac myocytes, as well as the current passed in response to premature depolarizations that normally helps protect against the formation of ectopic beats (Phan et al. 2017). Interactions of beta1 integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulate distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 (Becchetti et al. 2017). ERG1 is sensitive to the alkaloid, ginsenoside 20(S) Rg3 which alters the gating of hERG1 channels by interacting with and stabilizing the voltage sensor domain in an activated state (Gardner et al. 2017). Channels split at the S4-S5 linker, at the intracellular S2-S3 loop, and at the extracellular S3-S4 loop are fully functional channel proteins (de la Pe\u00f1a et al. 2018). IKr is the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, the ion current largely responsible for the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Inherited forms of long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans are linked to functional modifications in the Kv11.1 (hERG) ion channel and potentially life threatening arrhythmias. hERG1b affects the generation of the cardiac Ikr and plays an important role in cardiac electrophysiology (Perissinotti et al. 2018). X-ray crystallography and cryoEM have revealed features of the \"nonswapped\" transmembrane architecture, an \"intrinsic ligand,\" and small hydrophobic pockets off a pore cavity.

Cardiotoxicity is caused mainly by the inhibition of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel protein which leads to a life-threatening condition known as cardiac arrhythmia and is due to probable collapse of the pore. (Koulgi et al. 2021). Transmembrane hERG channel currents have been measured based on solvent-free lipid bilayer microarrays (Miyata et al. 2021). A computational method for identifying an optimal combination of existing drugs to repair the action potentials of SQT1 ventricular myocytes has been published (J\u00e6ger et al. 2021).

The 3-d structure has been determined at 3.8 \u00c5 resolution using single-particle cryo-EM with calmodulin bound. The structure suggests a novel mechanism of voltage-dependent gating. Calmodulin binding closes the potassium pore (Whicher and MacKinnon 2016). Eag1 has three intracellular domains: PAS, C-linker, and CNBHD.\u00a0Whicher and MacKinnon 2019 demonstrated that the Eag1 intracellular domains are not required for voltage-dependent gating but likely interact with the VS to modulate gating. Specific interactions between the PAS, CNBHD, and VS domains modulate voltage-dependent gating, and VS movement destabilizes these interactions to promote channel opening. Mutations affecting these interactions render Eag1 insensitive to calmodulin inhibition (Whicher and MacKinnon 2019). The structure of the calmodulin insensitive mutant in a pre-open conformation suggests that channel opening may occur through a rotation of the intracellular domains, and calmodulin may prevent this rotation by stabilizing interactions between the VS and the other intracellular domains. Intracellular domains likely play a similar modulatory role in voltage-dependent gating of the related Kv11-12 channels. The human ortholog, EAG or EAG-1, is 989 aas long and is 95% identical to the rat protein.

It therefore contributes to repolarization of the membrane potential, and it plays a key role in controlling excitability in a number of systems. Ethanol and carbon monoxide-bound heme increase channel activation while heme inhibits channel activation (Tang et al. 2003). The molecular structures of the human Slo1 channel in complex with beta4 has been solved revealing four beta4 subunits, each containing two transmembrane helices, encircling Slo1, contacting it through helical interactions inside the membrane. On the extracellular side, beta4 forms a tetrameric crown over the pore. Structures with high and low Ca2+ concentrations show that identical gating conformations occur in the absence and presence of beta4, implying that beta4 serves to modulate the relative stabilities of 'pre-existing' conformations rather than creating new ones (Tao and MacKinnon 2019).

The pH-sensor is built of a sensory cloud rather than of single key amino acids (Gonzalez et al., 2011). The transmembrane core region of KAT1 is important for its activity in S. cerevisiae, and this involves not only the pore region but also parts of its voltage-sensor domain (Saito et al. 2017). Electromechanical coupling and gating polarity in KAT1 displays a depolarized voltage sensor, which interacts with a closed pore domain directly via two interfaces and indirectly via an intercalated phospholipid. Direct interaction between the sensor and the C-linker hairpin in the adjacent pore subunit is the primary determinant of gating polarity (Clark et al. 2020). Possibly an inward motion of the S4 sensor helix of 5-7 \u00c5 underlies a direct-coupling mechanism, driving a conformational reorientation of the C-linker and ultimately opening the activation gate formed by the S6 intracellular bundle. KAT1, and presumably other hyperpolarization-gated plant CNBD channels, can open from an S4-down VSD conformation homologous to the divalent\/proton-inhibited conformation of EAG family K+ channels (Zhou et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 5NWJ  PBDID: 6V1X  PBDID: 6V1Y  PBDID: 7CAL"},{"0":"1.A.1.5.10","1":"Orthologue K+\/Na+\u00a0pacemaker channel,\u00a0Hcn4 (Scicchitano et al., 2012). Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated HCN channels underlie the Na+-K+ permeable IH pacemaker current. As with other voltage-gated members of the 6-transmembrane KV channel superfamily, opening of HCN channels involves dilation of a helical bundle formed by the intracellular ends of S6, but this is promoted by inward, not outward, displacement of S4. Direct agonist binding to a ring of cyclic nucleotide-binding sites, one of which lies immediately distal to each S6 helix, imparts cAMP sensitivity to HCN channel opening. At depolarized potentials, HCN channels are further modulated by intracellular Mg2+ which blocks the open channel pore and blunts the inhibitory effect of outward K+ flux. Lyashchenko et al. 2014 showed that cAMP binding to the gating ring enhances not only channel opening but also the kinetics of Mg2+ block. Mutations in HCN4 cause sick sinus and the Brugada syndrome, cardiac abnormalities. HCN4 is associated with famiial sinus bradycardia (Boulton et al. 2017). Activation of Hcn4 by cAMP has been reviewed (Porro et al. 2020).

Comparison of open\/closed pore states shows that the cytosolic gate opens through concerted movements of the S5 and S6 transmembrane helices.

HCN channels contain cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNBDs) in their C-terminal regions, linked to the pore-forming transmembrane segment with a C-linker. The C-linker couples the conformational changes caused by the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides to the HCN pore opening. Cyclic dinucleotides antagonize the effect of cyclic nucleotides in HCN4 but not in HCN2 channels.

These channels open after only two S4s have moved, and S4 motion is rate limiting during voltage activation of spHCN channels (Bruening-Wright et al. 2007). HCN channels regulate electrical activity in the heart and brain. Distinct from mammalian isoforms, the sea urchin (spHCN) channel exhibits strong voltage-dependent inactivation in the absence of cAMP (Idikuda et al. 2018). The voltage sensor undergoes a large downward motion during hyperpolarization (Dai et al. 2019). Sea urchin HCN1 and 2 (TC# 1.A.1.5.33) (spHCN) channels undergo inactivation with hyperpolarization which occurs only in the absence of cyclic nucleotide (Dai et al. 2021). Removing cAMP produces a largely rigid-body rotation of the C-linker relative to the transmembrane domain, bringing the A' helix of the C-linker in close proximity to the voltage-sensing S4 helix. In addition, rotation of the C-linker is elicited by hyperpolarization minus cAMP. Thus, in contrast to electromechanical coupling for channel activation - the A' helix serves to couple the S4-helix movement for channel inactivation, which is likely a conserved mechanism for CNBD-family channels (Dai et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 2PTM"},{"0":"1.A.1.5.31","1":"Multi-domain cation channel with a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain; of 465 aas and 6 TMS, LliK.

Thus, TARPs modulate the pharmacology and gating of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Soto et al. 2014). TARPs interact with the N-terminal domain of the AMPAR and control channel gating; residues in the receptor and the TARP involved in this interaction have been identified (Cais et al. 2014). The auxilary protein, Shisa9 or CKAMP44 (UniProt acc# B4DS77), has a C-terminal PDZ domain that allows interaction with scaffolding proteins and AMPA glutamate receptors (Karataeva et al. 2014). The transmembrane domain alone can tetramerize (Gan et al. 2016). The most potent and well-tolerated AMPA receptor inhibitors, used to treat epilepsy, act via a noncompetitive mechanism.

The inhibitors bind to a binding site, completely conserved between rat and human, at the interface between the ion channel and linkers connecting it to the ligand-binding domains (Yelshanskaya et al. 2016). The endogenous neuropeptide, cyclopropylglycine, at a physiological concentration of 1 \u03bcM, enhances the transmembrane AMPA currents in rat cerebellar Purkinje cells (Gudasheva et al. 2016).

The native heterotetrameric AMPA-R adopts various conformations, which reflect a variable separation of the two dimeric extracellular amino-terminal domains; members of the stargazin\/TARP family of transmembrane proteins co-purify with AMPA-Rs and contribute to the density representing the transmembrane region of the complex. Glutamate and cyclothiazide altered the conformational equilibrium of the channel complex, suggesting that desensitization is related to separation of the N-terminal domains (Nakagawa et al. 2005). Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of AMPA receptors boost cognitive performance in clinical studies, and mibampator and BIIB104 discriminate between AMPARs complexed with distinct TARPs, and particularly those with lower stargazin\/gamma2 efficacy such as BIIB104 (Ishii et al. 2020).

A structure showing an agoniar-bound form of the rat GluA2 receptor revealed conformational changes that occur during gating (Yelshanskaya et al. 2014). GluR2 interacts directly with \u03b23 integrin (Pozo et al., 2012). In general, integrin receptors form macromolelcular complexes with ion channels (Becchetti et al. 2010). TARPS are required for AMP receptor function and trafficking, but seven other auxiliary subunits have also been identified (Sumioka 2013). For example, AMPA receptors are regulated by S-SCAM through TARPs (Danielson et al. 2012). The C-terminal domains of various TARPs (TC#8.A.16.2) play direct roles in the regulation of GluRs (Sager et al. 2011). Whole-genome analyses have linked multiple TARP loci to childhood epilepsy, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (Kato et al. 2010). Thus, TARPs emerge as vital components of excitatory synapses that participate both in signal transduction and in neuropsychiatric disorders. The architecture of a fully occupied GluR2-TARP complex has been illucidated by cryoEM, showing the homomeric GluA2 AMPA receptor saturated with TARP \u03a52 subunits, showing how the TARPs are arranged with four-fold symmetry around the ion channel domain, making extensive interactions with the M1, M2 and M4 TMSs (Zhao et al. 2016).

GRIN variants in receptor M2 channel pore-forming loop are associated with neurological diseases (Li et al. 2019). Disease-associated variants have revealed mechanistic aspect of the NMDA receptor (Amin et al. 2021). Cross-subunit interactions that stabilize open states mediate gating in NMDA receptors (Iacobucci et al. 2021). The gating mechanism and a modulatory niche of human GluN1-GluN2A NMDA receptors have been reported (Wang et al. 2021). GluN2A and GluN2B NMDA receptors apparently use distinct allosteric routes (Tian et al. 2021). A negative allosteric modulatory site in the GluN1 M4 determines the efficiency of neurosteroid modulation (Langer et al. 2021). Excitatory signaling mediated by NMDAR is critical for brain development and function, as well as for neurological diseases and disorders. Channel blockers of NMDARs can be used for treating depression, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy.\u00a0Chou et al. 2022 monitored the binding of three clinically important channel blockers: phencyclidine, ketamine, and memantine in GluN1-2B NMDARs at local resolutions of 2.5-3.5\u00a0\u00c5 around the binding site. The channel blockers form interactions with pore-lining residues, which control mostly off-speeds but not on-speeds (Chou et al. 2022). NMDAR channel blockers include MK-801, phencyclidine, ketamine, and the Alzheimer's disease drug memantine, can bind and unbind only when the NMDAR channel is open. NMDAR channel blockers can enter the channel through two routes: the well-known hydrophilic path from extracellular solution to channel through the open channel gate, and also a hydrophobic path from plasma membrane to channel through a gated fenestration (Wilcox et al. 2022).

The domain architecture of a calcium-permeable AMPA receptor in a ligand-free conformation has been solved (Midgett et al., 2012). The TARP, stargazin, is elevated in the somatosensory cortex of Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats (Kennard et al. 2011). TARPs alter the conformation of pore-forming subunits and thereby affect antagonist interactions (Coki\u00c4\u0087 and Stein 2008). The structural basis of AMPAR regulation by TARP gamma2, or stargazin (STZ) involves variable interaction stoichiometries of the AMPAR-TARP complex, with one or two TARP molecules binding one tetrameric AMPAR (Twomey et al. 2016).

Mutations in the subunit, GRIN1, a 1464 aa protein, identified in patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and profound developmental delay, are located in the transmembrane domain and the linker region between the ligand-binding and transmembrane domains (Yuan et al. 2014; Ohba et al. 2015).

Ogden et al. 2017 implicated the pre-M1 region in gating, providing insight into how different subunits contribute to gating, and suggesting that mutations in the pre-M1 helix, such as those that cause epilepsy and developmental delays, can compromise neuronal health. The severity of GRIN2A (Glu2A)-related disorders can be predicted based on the positions of the mutations in the encoding gene (Strehlow et al. 2019). Knock-in mice expressing an ethanol-resistant GluN2A NMDA receptor subunit show altered responses to ethanol (Zamudio et al. 2019).

It catalyzes bidirectional transport, has a pentameric aquaporin-like (TC# 1.A.8) structure, and may function by a channel-type mechanism (Falke et al., 2009; Wang et al. 2009). The structure at 2.25 \u00c5 resolution has been determined (Wang et al., 2009). The protein is encoded in an operon with pyruvate-formate lyase, PflB. A pyruvate:formate antiport mechanism has been suggested (Moraes and Reithmeier 2012). The C-terminal 6 aas are required for formate transport, but not for homopentamer formation (Hunger et al. 2017). The N-terminus of FocA interacts with PflB, and this interaction is essential for optimal formate translocation (Doberenz et al. 2014). In fact, the GREs, TdcE and PflB, interact with the FNT channel protein, probably to control formate translocation by FocA (Falke et al. 2016). The lipophilic constrictions of FocA mainly act as barriers to isolate the central histidine from the aqueous bulk, preventing protonation via proton wires. Thus, an FNT transport model is supported in which the central histidine is uncharged, and weak acid substrate anion protonation occurs in the vestibule regions of the transporter before passing the constrictions (Schmidt and Beitz 2021). An interplay between the conserved pore residues Thr-91 and His-209 controls formate translocation through the FocA channel (Kammel et al. 2022). T91 is essential for formate permeation in both directions; however, it is particularly important to allow anion efflux. H209 is essential for formate uptake by FocA, strongly suggesting that protonation-deprotonation of this residue plays a role in formate uptake. These observations substantiate the premise that efflux and influx of formate by FocA are mechanistically distinct processes that are controlled by the interplay between T91 and H209 (Kammel et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 3kcu  PBDID: 3q7k"},{"0":"1.A.16.3.1","1":"Nitrite uptake\/efflux channel (Jia et al. 2009).","2":"PBDID: 4fc4"},{"0":"1.A.16.3.3","1":"Hydrosulfide (hydrogen sulfide; HS-), Fnt3 (Hsc) channel.

This cavity harbours a conserved Ca2+-binding site, located within the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Mutations of residues involved in Ca2+ coordination affect both lipid scrambling in N. haematococca TMEM16 and ion conduction in the Cl- channel of TMEM16A. The structure reveals the general architecture of the family and its mode of Ca2+ activation (Brunner et al. 2014). While the cytoplasmic portion of the protein is important for function, it does not appear to regulate scramblase activity via a detectable conformational change (Andra et al. 2018). Dynamic modulation of the lipid translocation groove generates a conductive ion channel in Ca2+-bound nhTMEM16 (Khelashvili et al. 2019) (see family description).

There, the conformation of transmembrane helices, constituting a membrane-spanning furrow that provides a path for lipids in scramblases, is replaced to form an enclosed aqueous pore that is largely shielded from the membrane (Paulino et al. 2017). It thus provides a pathway for anions such as Cl-. During activation, the binding of Ca2+ to a site located within the transmembrane domain, in the vicinity of the pore, alters the electrostatic properties of the ion conduction path and triggers a conformational rearrangement of an \u03b1-helix that comes into physical contact with the bound ligand, and thereby directly couples ligand binding and pore opening (Paulino et al. 2017). The E143A mutant showed reduced sensitivity to Ca2+ but not to high temperatures, whereas the E705V mutant exhibited reduced sensitivity to both Ca2+ and noxious heat (Choi et al. 2018). Loss of TMEM16A resulted in reduced nephron number and, subsequently, albuminuria and tubular damage (Schenk et al. 2018). mAno1 expression is regulated via alternative promoters, and its transcriptional variation results in variation of the N-terminal sequence of the Ano1 protein due to alternative translation initiation sites (Kamikawa et al. 2018). The Ca2+ gating mechanism of TMEM16A, involving a Ca2+-sensing element close to the anion pore, alters conduction and substrate selection. De Jes\u00fas-P\u00e9rez et al. 2022 studied the gating-permeant anion relationship using mouse TMEM16A, showing that the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity increases with highly permeant anions and SCN- mole fractions, likely by stabilizing bound Ca2+. Conversely, mutations in crucial gating elements, including the Ca2+-binding  site 1,TMS 6, and the hydrophobic gate, impaired anion permeability and  selectivity. Thus, there is a reciprocal rationship between gating and selectivity (De Jes\u00fas-P\u00e9rez et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 5NL2  PBDID: 5OYB  PBDID: 5OYG  PBDID: 6BGI  PBDID: 6BGJ"},{"0":"1.A.17.1.26","1":"Anoctamin-10 or TMEM16K of 660 aas and 9 or 10 TMSs.

Functional properties and structure are known (Hong and Degrado 2012). The cytoplasmic tail facilitates proton conduction (Liao et al. 2015). It is a dimer of dimers (Andreas et al. 2015). The four TMSs flanking the channel lumen alone seem to determine the proton conduction mechanism (Liang et al. 2016). His-37 forms a planar tetrad in the configuration of the bundle accepting and translocating the incoming protons from the N terminal side, exterior of the virus, to the C terminal side, inside the virus (Kalita and Fischer 2017). The cholesterol binding site in M2 that mediates membrane scission in a cholesterol-dependent manner to cause virus budding and release has been identified (Elkins et al. 2017).Transport-related conformational changes coupled to water and H+ movements have been studied (Mandala et al. 2018).

The C-terminal domain of M2 may serve as a sensor that regulates how M2 participates in critical events in the viral infection cycle (Kim et al. 2019). The M2 proton channel protein self-assembles into tetramers that retain the ability to bind to the drug amantadine, and the effects of phospholipid acyl chain length and cholesterol on the peptide association were investigated. Association of the helices depends on the thickness of the bilayer and cholesterol levels present in the phospholipid bilayer. The most favorable folding occurred when there was a good match between the width of the apolar region of the bilayer and the hydrophobic length of the transmembrane helix with tighter association upon inclusion of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer (Cristian et al. 2003).","2":"PBDID: 1NYJ  PBDID: 2H95"},{"0":"1.A.2.1.10","1":"G-protein-activated inward rectifying K+ channel, Kir3.2, KATP2, KCNJ6, KCNJ7 or GIRK2 of 423 aas and 2 TMSs (Inanobe et al., 2011; Yokogawa et al. 2011). Mutations cause the Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome (Gao et al. 2022). It functions in electrical signaling in neurons and muscle cells (Weng et al. 2021), being important in regulating heart rate and neuronal excitability. It is activated by binding of the \u03b2\u03b3-subunit complex to the cytoplasmic pore gate (Yokogawa et al. 2011).\u00a0Chen et al. 2017 found that GIRK channels are activated by Ivermectin (IVM). Cholesterol binds to and upregulates GIRK channels (GIRK2 and 4), and the binding sites have been determined (Rosenhouse-Dantsker 2018). An inherited gain-of-function mutation in the human GIRK3.4 causes familial human sinus node dysfunction (SND). The increased activity of GIRK channels likely leads to a sustained hyperpolarization of pacemaker cells and thereby reduces heart rate (Ku\u00df et al. 2019). GIRK2 channels are abundantly expressed in the heart and require that phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) is present so that intracellular channel-gating regulators such as Gbetagamma (G\u03b2\u03b3) and Na+ ions maintain the channel-open state.\u00a0Li et al. 2019 determined how each regulator uses channel domain movements to control gate transitions. Na+ controls the cytosolic gate of the channel through an anti-clockwise rotation, whereas G\u03b2\u03b3 stabilizes the transmembrane gate in the open state through a rocking movement of the cytosolic domain. Both effects altered the way by which the channel interacts with PIP2 and thereby stabilizes the open states of the respective gates (Li et al. 2019). The protein plays a role in heart atrial fibrillation-valvular heart disease (VHD) (Zhao et al. 2021). Measurements of ligand binding and channel current have been made (Usher et al. 2021). CryoEM structures of GIRK2 in the presence and absence of the cholesterol analog cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) reveal that CHS binds near PIP2 in lipid-facing hydrophobic pockets of the transmembrane domain, suggesting that CHS stabilizes the PIP2 interaction with the channel to promote engagement of the cytoplasmic domain with the transmembrane region (Mathiharan et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 3sya  PBDID: 3syc  PBDID: 3syp"},{"0":"1.A.2.1.17","1":"KCNJ11 or Kir6.2 or KATP of 390 aas; 96% identical to the rat homologue, TC# 1.A.2.1.7. Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is characterized by persistent insulin secretion despite severe hypoglycemia. Mutations in the pancreatic ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channel proteins sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and Kir6.2, encoded by ABCC8 and KCNJ11, respectively, is the most common cause of the disease. Many mutations in SUR1 render the channel unable to traffic to the cell surface, thereby reducing channel function. Many studies have shown that for some SUR1 trafficking mutants, the defects could be corrected by treating cells with sulfonylureas or diazoxide (Yan et al. 2007). Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the  concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive  voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium (Tammaro and Ashcroft 2007). Kir6.2 is an ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel coupling cell metabolism to electrical activity by regulating K+ fluxes across the plasma membrane. Channel closure is facilitated by ATP, which binds to the pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2). Conversely, channel opening is potentiated by phosphoinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), which binds to Kir6.2 and reduces channel inhibition by ATP. The PIP2 binding site has been identified (Haider et al. 2007). KATP channels are metabolic sensors that couple cell energetics to membrane excitability. In pancreatic beta-cells, channels formed by SUR1 and Kir6.2 regulate insulin secretion and are the targets of antidiabetic sulfonylureas.\u00a0Martin et al. 2017 used cryo-EM to elucidate the structural basis of channel assembly and gating. The structure, determined in the presence of ATP and the sulfonylurea, glibenclamide, at ~6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, revealed a closed Kir6.2 tetrameric core with four peripheral SUR1s, each anchored to a Kir6.2 by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP2 binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest that SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP2 binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity (Martin et al. 2017). a cryo-EM structure of a hamster SUR1\/rat Kir6.2 channel bound to a high-affinity sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide and ATP has been solved at 3.63 \u00c5 resolution. The structure shows that glibenclamide is lodged in the transmembrane bundle of the SUR1-ABC core connected to the first nucleotide binding domain near the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer (Martin et al. 2017). The activation of K(ATP) channels contributes to the shortening of action potential duration but is not the primary cause of extracellular K+ accumulation during early myocardial ischemia (Saito et al. 2005). KATP binds nucleotides (Usher et al. 2021). Mitochondrial KATP channels stabilize intracellular Ca2+ during hypoxia in retinal horizontal cells of goldfish (Carassius auratus) (Country and Jonz 2021). Medicinal plant products can interact with KATP (Rajabian et al. 2022). Remodeling of excitation-contraction coupling in transgenic mice expressing ATP-insensitive sarcolemmal KATP channels has been observed (Flagg et al. 2004). Thus, a compensatory increase in I(Ca) counteracts a mild activation of ATP-insensitive K(ATP) channels. Pharmacological inhibitors and ATP enrich a channel conformation in which the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain is closely associated with the transmembrane domain, while depleting one where the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain is extended away into the cytoplasm. This conformational change remodels a network of intra- and inter-subunit interactions as well as the ATP and PIP2 binding pockets. The structures resolved key contacts between the distal N-terminus of Kir6.2 and SUR1's ABC module involving residues implicated in channel function and showed a SUR1 residue, K134, participates in PIP2 binding. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed two Kir6.2 residues, K39 and R54, that mediate both ATP and PIP2 binding, suggesting a mechanism for competitive gating by ATP and PIP2 (Sung et al. 2022). The natural product, 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HC), exhibits pharmacological properties linked to antihypertensive mechanisms of action. This relaxant effect induced by 7-HC relies on K+-channels (KATP, BKCa, and, to a lesser extent, Kv) activation and also on Ca2+ influx from sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum mobilization (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine receptors) (Jesus et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 6C3O  PBDID: 6C3P"},{"0":"1.A.2.1.18","1":"Inward rectifier potassium channel 4, KCNJ4, IRK3 or 4, of 445 aas.

Flecainide increases Kir2.1 currents by interacting with cysteine 311, decreasing the polyamine-induced rectification (Caballero et al., 2010). The inhibitory cholesterol binding site has been identified (F\u00fcrst et al. 2014). Polyamines and Mg2+ block ion flux synergistically (Huang and Kuo 2016). Long polyamines serve a dual role as both blockers and coactivators (with PIP2) of Kir2.1 channels (Xie et al. 2005).

Domain organization studies show which domains in Sur and Kir6.2 interact (Wang et al. 2012). KATP channels consisting of Kir6.2 and SUR1 couple cell metabolism to membrane excitability and regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, and mutations in the former protein can compensate for mutations in the latter (Zhou et al. 2013). Mutations cause inactivation of channel function by disrupting PIP2-dependent gating (Bushman et al. 2013). Thus, these proteins comprise part of the glucose sensing mechanism (Rufino et al. 2013). A single point mutation can confer voltage sensitivity (Kurata et al. 2010). Its involvement in type II diabetes has been reviewed by Bonfanti et al. 2015.\u00a0KATP channels (Kir6.2\/SUR1) in the brain and endocrine pancreas couple metabolic status to the membrane potential. In beta-cells, increases in cytosolic [ATP\/ADP] inhibit KATP channel activity, leading to membrane depolarization and exocytosis of insulin granules. Mutations in ABCC8 (SUR1) or KCNJ11 (Kir6.2) can result in gain or loss of channel activity and cause neonatal diabetes (ND) or congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), respectively. Nucleotide binding without hydrolysis switches SUR1 to stimulatory conformations. Increased affinity for ATP gives rise to ND while decreased affinty gives rise to CHI (Ortiz and Bryan 2015). Kir6.2 can associate with either SUR1 (TC# 3.A.1.208.4) or SUR2A (TC# 3.A.1.208.23) to form heteroctamers, leading to different locations and consequences (Principalli et al. 2015). IATP channels and Ca2+ influx play roles in purinergic vasotoxicity and cell death (Shibata et al. 2018).  A cryo-EM structure of a hamster SUR1\/rat Kir6.2 channel bound to a high-affinity sulfonylurea drug, glibenclamide, and ATP at 3.63 A resolution revealed details of the ATP and glibenclamide binding sites (Martin et al. 2017). The structure showed that glibenclamide lodges in the transmembrane bundle of the SUR1-ABC core connected to the first nucleotide binding domain near the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer.

Closure of the Kir1.1 pH gate results from steric occlusion of the permeation path by the convergence of four leucines (or phenylalanines) at the cytoplasmic apex of the inner transmembrane helices. In the open state, K+ crosses the pH gate together with its hydration shell (Sackin et al. 2005). An inhibitory cholesterol binding site has been identified (F\u00fcrst et al. 2014). Conformational changes associated with an open activation gate have been identified, and these suggest an allosteric pathway that ties the selectivity filter to the activation gate through interactions between both transmembrane helices, the turret, the selectivity filter loop, and the pore helix. Specific residues involved in this conformational exchange that are highly conserved among human Kir channels have also been identified (Amani et al. 2020). Anionic lipids, especially cardiolipin, initiate a concerted rotation of the cytoplasmic domain subunits. This action buries ionic side chains away from the bulk water, while allowing water greater access to the K+ conduction pathway (Borcik et al. 2020).

Channel conductance and size selectivity are largely determined by pore diameter, whereas charge selectivity results from the amino-terminal domains; transitions between fully open and (multiple) closed states involves global changes in structure of the pore-forming domains (Ek Vitor\u00edn et al. 2016). The human Cx43 orthologue is almost identical to the rat protein. It may mediate resistance against the parkinsonian toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+) which induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells by modulating mitochondrial apoptosis (Kim et al. 2016). Dopamine neurons may be the target of MPP+ and play a role in Parkinson's disease. In humans, Cx43 plays roles in the development of the central nervous system and in the progression of glioma (Wang et al. 2017). It interacts with and is regulated by many proteins including NOV (CCN3, IGFBP9; P48745) (Giepmans 2006). Cx43 plays roles in intercellular communication mediated by extracellular vesicles, tunnelling nanotubes and gap junctions (Ribeiro-Rodrigues et al. 2017). Phosphorylation of Cx43 leads to astrocytic coupling and apoptosis, and ultimately, to vascular regeneration in retinal ischemia. Paxillin (Pxn; 591 aas; P49023), a cytoskeletal protein involved in focal adhesion, leads to changes in connexin 43 by direct protein-protein binding, thereby influencing osteocyte gap junction elongation (Zhang et al. 2018). Regulation of Cx43 abundance involves transcriptional\/post-transcriptional and translational\/post-translational mechanisms that are modulated by an interplay between TGF-beta isoforms and PGE2, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma (Cheng et al. 2018). In the developing fetal human kidney, cytoplasmic expression of Cx36 was localized to nephrons in different developmental stages, glomerular vessels and collecting ducts, and of Cx43 was localized to the endothelium of glomerular and peritubular vessels, as well as to the epithelium of the proximal tubules (R\u00e1duly et al. 2019). Mutations in the gap junction protein \u03b11 (GPA1) gene cause oculodentodigital dysplasia (Pace et al. 2019). Expression of connexin 43 is elevated in atypical fibroxanthoma cells (Fernandez-Flores et al. 2020). Astrocytic connexin43 channels are candidate targets in epilepsy treatment (Walrave et al. 2020). Cx43 plays roles in physiological functions such as regulating cell growth, differentiation, and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Sha et al. 2020). Amyloid-beta (TC# 1.C.50) regulates connexin 43 trafficking in cultured primary astrocytes (Maulik et al. 2020). Gap junction protein Cx43 plays a role in regulating cellular function and paracrine effects of smooth muscle progenitor cells (Tien (\u00e7\u0094\u00b0\u00e5\u00a9\u00b7\u00e6\u0080\u00a1) et al. 2021). A serine residues in the connexin43 carboxyl tail is important for B-cell antigen receptor-mediated spreading of B-lymphocytes (Pournia et al. 2020). Connexin 43 plays an antagonistic role in the development of primary bone tumors as a tumor suppressor and also as a tumor promoter (Talbot et al. 2020). Retinal astrocytes abundantly express Cx43 that forms gap junction (GJ) channels and unopposed hemichannels, and Cx43 is upregulated in retinal injuries. Astrocytic Cx43 plays a role in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss associated with injury (Toychiev et al. 2021). Screens for inhibitors of Cx43 hemichannel function have revealed several candidates (Soleilhac et al. 2021). The dodecameric channel is formed by the end-to-end docking of two hexameric connexons, each comprised of 24 transmembrane alpha-helices (Cheng et al. 2019). Cx43 appears to be involved in the tumorigenesis of most pituitary adenomas and have a potential therapeutic value for pituitary tumor therapy (Nunes et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1R5S  PBDID: 3CYY  PBDID: 2N8T"},{"0":"1.A.24.1.13","1":"Connexin36, connexin delta2, Cx\u03b42, GJD2, Cx36 of 321 aas and 4 TMSs.

Cx43 is localized to the endothelium of glomerular and peritubular vessels, as well as to the epithelium of the proximal tubules (R\u00e1duly et al. 2019). A reciprocal relationship between Cx36 and seizure-associated neuronal hyperactivityhas been obseerved; thus, Cx36 deficiency contributes to region-specific susceptibility to neuronal hyperactivity, while neuronal hyperactivity-induced downregulation of Cx36 may increase the risk of future epileptic events (Brunal et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 2N6A"},{"0":"1.A.24.1.3","1":"Heteromeric connexin (Cx)32\/Cx26; (CxB2, GJ\u03b22, GJB2) (transports cAMP, cGMP and all inositol phosphates with 1-4 esterified phosphate groups (homomeric Cx26(\u03b22) or homomeric Cx32 do not transport the inositol phosphates as well) (Ayad et al., 2006).\u00a0The GJB2 gene encodes connexin 26, the protein involved in cell-cell attachment in many tissues. GJB2 mutations cause autosomal recessive (DFNB1) and sometimes dominant (DFNA3) non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss as well as various skin disease phenotypes (Iossa et al., 2011; Tian et al. 2022). TMS1 regulates oligomerization and function (Jara et al., 2012). The carboxyl tail pg Cx32 regulates gap junction assembly (Katoch et al. 2015). In Cx46, neutralization of negative charges or addition of positive charge in the Cx26 equivalent region reduced the slow gate voltage dependence. In Cx50 the addition of a glutamate in the same region decreased the voltage dependence and the neutralization of a negative charge increased it. Thus, the charges at the end of TMS1 are part of the slow gate voltage sensor in Cxs. The fact that Cx42, which has no charge in this region, still presents voltage dependent slow gating suggests that charges still unidentified also contribute to the slow gate voltage sensitivity (Pinto et al. 2016). Syndromic deafness mutations at Asn14 alter the open stability of Cx26 hemichannels (Sanchez et al. 2016). The Leu89Pro substitution in the second TMS of CX32 disrupts the trafficking of the protein, inhibiting the assembly of CX32 gap junctions, which in turn may result in peripheral neuropathy (Da et al. 2016). Cx26 mutants that promote cell death or exert transdominant effects on other connexins in keratinocytes lead to skin diseases and hearing loss, whereas mutants having reduced channel function without aberrant effects on coexpressed connexins cause only hearing loss (Press et al. 2017). When challenged by a field of 0.06 V\/nm, the Cx26 hemichannel relaxed toward a novel configuration characterized by a widened pore and an increased bending of the second TMS at the level of the conserved Pro87. A point mutation that inhibited such a transition impeded hemichannel opening in electrophysiology and dye uptake experiments. Thus, the Cx26 hemichannel uses a global degree of freedom to transit between different configuration states, which may be shared among all connexins (Zonta et al. 2018). A group of human mutations within the N-terminal (NT) domain of connexin 26 hemichannels produce aberrant channel activity, which gives rise to deafness and skin disorders, including keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome. Structural and functional studies indicate that the NT domain of connexin hemichannels is folded into the pore, where it plays important roles in permeability and gating. The mutation, N14K disrupts cytosolic intersubunit interactions and promotes channel opening (Valdez Capuccino et al. 2018). A missense mutation in the Connexin 26 gene is associated with hereditary autosomal recessive sensorineural deafness (Leshinsky-Silver et al. 2005, Zytsar et al. 2020). Cx26 hemichannels mediate the passage of contents between the cytoplasm and extracellular space. To generate hemichannels, the mutation N176Y was introduced into the second extracellular loop of Cx26. The cryoEM structure of the hexameric hemichannel in lipid bilayer nanodiscs displays an open pore and a 4-helix bundle transmembrane design that is nearly identical to dodecameric GJCs. In contrast to the high resolution of the transmembrane alpha-helices, the extracellular loops are less well resolved. The conformational flexibility of the extracellular loops may be essential to facilitate surveillance of hemichannels in apposed cells to identify compatible Cx isoforms that enable intercellular docking (Khan et al. 2021). A rare variant c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) in the GJB2 (connexin 26) gene is associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (Maslova et al. 2021). Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene (Asgari et al. 2020). An increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) has been shown to cause Cx26 gap junctions to close. Cryo-EM was used to determine the structure of human Cx26 gap junctions under increasing levels of PCO2.\u00a0Brotherton et al. 2022 showed a correlation between the level of PCO2 and the size of the aperture of the pore, governed by the N-terminal helices that line the pore. Thus, CO2 alone is sufficient to cause conformational changes in the protein. Analysis of the conformational states showed that movements at the N-terminus are linked to both subunit rotation and flexing of the transmembrane helices (Brotherton et al. 2022). Cysteine residues in the C-terminal tail of connexin32 regulate its trafficking (Ray and Mehta 2021).","2":"PBDID: 1TXH  PBDID: 5KK9  PBDID: 1XIR  PBDID: 2ZW3  PBDID: 3IZ1  PBDID: 3IZ2  PBDID: 5er7  PBDID: 5ERA  PBDID: 5KJ3  PBDID: 5KJG  PBDID: 6UVR  PBDID: 6UVS  PBDID: 6UVT"},{"0":"1.A.24.1.7","1":"Connexin 30 complex (connexin30.2\/connexin31.3 (CX30.2\/CX31.3)).

Liang et al. (2011) suggested that it shares functional properties with pannexin hemichannels rather than gap junction channels. Defects cause nonsyndromic hypoacusia (hearing loss) due to partial loss of channel activity (Su et al. 2012; Su et al. 2013; Cascella et al. 2016). Cx30, but not Cx43, hemichannels close upon protein kinase C activation, showing that connexin hemichannels display not only isoform-specific permeability profiles but also isoform-specific regulation by PKC (Alstrom et al. 2015).

Pannexin1 is part of the pore forming unit of the P2X(7) receptor death complex (Locovei et al., 2007). It can catalyze ATP release from cells (Huang and Roper, 2010) and promote ATP signalling in mice (Suadicani et al. 2012). It also promotes acetaminophen liver toxicity by allowing it to enter the cell (Maes et al. 2016). Pannexin1 and pannexin2 channels show quaternary similarities to connexons but different oligomerization numbers (Ambrosi et al., 2010).\u00a0Pannexin 1 constitutes the large conductance cation channel of cardiac myocytes (Kienitz et al., 2011). Pannexin 1 (Px1, Panx1) and pannexin 2 (Px2, Panx2) underlie channel function in neurons and contribute to ischemic brain damage (Bargiotas et al., 2011). Single cysteines in the extracellular and transmembrane regions modulate pannexin 1 channel function (Bunse et al., 2011). Spreading depression triggers migraine headaches by activating neuronal pannexin1 (panx1) channels (Karatas et al. 2013). The channel in the mouse orthologue opens upon apoptosis (Spagnol et al. 2014). Transports ATP out of the cell since L-carbenoxolone (a Panx1 channel blocker) inhibits ATP release from the nasal mucosa, but flufenamic acid (a connexin channel blocker) and gadolinium (a stretch-activated channel blocker) do not (Ohbuchi et al. 2014). CALHM1 (TC#1.N.1.1.1) and PANX1 both play roles in ATP release and downstream ciliary beat frequency modulation following a mechanical stimulus in airway epithelial cells (Workman et al. 2017). Pannexin1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of liver disease (Willebrords et al. 2018). Inhibition of pannexin1 channel opening may provide a novel approach for the treatment of drug (acetaminophen-induced)-induced hepatotoxicity (Maes et al. 2017). Pannexin-1 is necessary for capillary tube formation on Matrigel and for VEGF-C-induced invasion. It is highly expressed in HDLECs and is required for in vitro lymphangiogenesis (Boucher et al. 2018). cryo-EM structure of a pannexin 1 reveals unique motifs for ion selection and inhibition. The cryo-EM structure of a pannexin 1 revealed unique motifs for ion selection and inhibition (Michalski et al. 2020). In another study,\u00a0Deng et al. 2020 obtained near-atomic-resolution structures of human and frog PANX1 determined by cryo-EM that revealed a heptameric channel architecture. Compatible with ATP permeation, the transmembrane pore and cytoplasmic vestibule were exceptionally wide. An extracellular tryptophan ring located at the outer pore created a constriction site, potentially functioning as a molecular sieve that restricts the sizes of permeable substrates. Pannexin 1 channels in renin-expressing cells influence renin secretion and homeostasis (DeLalio et al. 2020). Structures of human pannexin 1 have revealed ion pathways and mechanism of gating (Ruan et al. 2020). PANX1 is critical for functions such as blood pressure regulation, apoptotic cell clearance and human oocyte development. Ruan et al. 2020 presented several structures of human PANX1 in a heptameric assembly at resolutions of up to 2.8 \u00c5, including an apo state, a caspase-7-cleaved state and a carbenoxolone-bound state. A gating mechanism was revealed that involves two ion-conducting pathways. Under normal cellular conditions, the intracellular entry of the wide main pore is physically plugged by the C-terminal tail. Small anions are conducted through narrow tunnels in the intracellular domain. These tunnels connect to the main pore and are gated by a long linker between the N-terminal helix and the first transmembrane helix. During apoptosis, the C-terminal tail is cleaved by caspase, allowing the release of ATP through the main pore. A carbenoxolone (a channel blocker)-binding site is embraced by W74 in the extracellular entrance. A gap-junction-like structure was observed as expected (Yen and Saier 2007; Chou et al. 2017). Navis et al. 2020 provided a review of the literature on Panx1 structural biology and known pharmacological agents that target it. The R217H mutation perturbs the conformational flexibility of the C-terminus, leading to channel dysfunction (Purohit and Bera 2021). Panx1 plays decisive roles in multiple physiological and pathological settings, including oxygen delivery to tissues, mucociliary clearance in airways, sepsis, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy. It exerts some of these roles in the context of purinergic signaling by providing a transmembrane pathway for ATP, but Panx1 can also act as a highly selective membrane channel for chloride ions without ATP permeability (Mim et al. 2021). Pannexin 1 regulates skeletal muscle regeneration by promoting bleb-based myoblast migration and fusion through a lipid based signaling mechanism (Suarez-Berumen et al. 2021). Pannexin-1 activation by phosphorylation is crucial for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation (Metz and Elvers 2022). Data suggest that in response to hypotonic stress, the intact rat lens is capable of releasing ATP. This seems to be mediated via the opening of pannexin channels in a specific zone of the outer cortex of the lens (Suzuki-Kerr et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 6LTN  PBDID: 6LTO  PBDID: 6M02  PBDID: 6M66  PBDID: 6M67  PBDID: 6M68  PBDID: 6V6D  PBDID: 6WBF  PBDID: 6WBG  PBDID: 6WBI  PBDID: 6WBK  PBDID: 6WBL  PBDID: 6WBM  PBDID: 6WBN"},{"0":"1.A.25.3.1","1":"The volume-regulated Anion Channel, VRAC, or volume-sensitive outward rectifying anion channel, VSOR. It is also called the SWELL1 protein. It consists of the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8A, with an N-terminal pannexin-like domain, LRRC8A, together with other LRRC8 subunits (B, C, D and E). The first two TMSs of the 4 TMS LRRC8 proteins appear as DUF3733 in CDD (Abascal and Zardoya, 2012). The C-terminal soluble domain shows sequence similarity to the heme-binding protein, Shv, and pollen-specific leucine-rich repeat extension-like proteins (3.A.20.1.1). The volume-regulated anion channel, VRAC, has LRRC8A as a VRAC component. It forms heteromers with other LRRC8 membrane proteins (Voss et al. 2014). Genomic disruption of LRRC8A ablated VRAC currents. Cells with disruption of all five LRRC8 genes required LRRC8A cotransfection with other LRRC8 isoforms to reconstitute VRAC currents. The isoform combination determined the VRAC inactivation kinetics. Taurine flux and regulatory volume decrease also depended on LRRC8 proteins. Thus, VRAC defines a class of anion channels, suggesting that VRAC is identical to the volume-sensitive organic osmolyte\/anion channel  VSOAC, and explains the heterogeneity of native VRAC currents (Voss et al. 2014). Point mutations in two amino-acyl residues (Lys98 and Asp100 in LRRC8A and equivalent residues in LRRC8C and -E) upon charge reversal, alter the kinetics and voltage-dependence of inactivation (Ullrich et al. 2016). Using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography,\u00a0Deneka et al. 2018 and Kasuya et al. 2018 determined the structures of a homomeric channel of the obligatory subunit LRRC8A. This protein conducts ions and has properties in common with endogenous heteromeric channels. Its modular structure consists of a transmembrane pore domain followed by a cytoplasmic leucine-rich repeat domain. The transmembrane domain, which is structurally related to connexins, is wide towards the cytoplasm but constricted on the outside by a structural unit that acts as a selectivity filter. An excess of basic residues in the filter and throughout the pore attracts anions by electrostatic interaction (Deneka et al. 2018). The structure shows a hexameric assembly, and the transmembrane region features a topology similar to gap junction channels. The LRR region, with 15 leucine-rich repeats, forms a long, twisted arc. The channel pore is located along the central axis and constricted on the extracellular side, where highly conserved polar and charged residues at the tip of the extracellular helix contribute to the permeability to anions and other osmolytes. Two structural populations were identified, corresponding to compact and relaxed conformations. Comparing the two conformations suggests that the LRR region is flexible and mobile with rigid-body motions, which might be implicated in structural transitions on pore opening (Kasuya et al. 2018). VRAC is inhibited by Tamoxifen and Mefloquine (Lee et al. 2017). The intracellular loop connecting TMSs 2 and 3 of LRRC8A and the first extracellular loop connecting transmembrane domains 1 and 2 of LRRC8C, LRRC8D, or LRRC8E are essential for VRAC activity (Yamada and Strange 2018). The N termini of the LRRC8 subunits may line the cytoplasmic portion of the VRAC pore, possibly by folding back into the ion permeation pathway (Zhou et al. 2018). On the adipocyte plasma membrane, the SWELL1-\/LRRC8 channel complex activates in response to increases in adipocyte volume in the context of obesity. SWELL1 is required for insulin-PI3K-AKT2 signalling to regulate adipocyte growth and systemic glycaemia (Gunasekar et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 5ZSU  PBDID: 6DJB  PBDID: 6M04"},{"0":"1.A.26.1.2","1":"The Mg2+ transporter, MgtE.

Causes Ca2+ release from the E.R. and consequent cardiac arrhythmia (Chelu and Wehrens, 2007). Associates with FKBP12.6, but phosphorylation by protein kinase A on serine-2030 causes dissociation (Jones et al., 2008). An interaction site for FKBP12.6 may be present at the RyR2 C terminus, proximal to the channel pore, a sterically appropriate location that would enable this protein to play a role in the modulation of this channel (Zissimopoulos and Lai 2005). Enhanced binding of calmodulin corrects arrhythmogenic channel disorder in myocytes (Fukuda et al. 2014). RyR2s can open spontaneously, giving rise to spatially-confined Ca2+ release events known as \"sparks.\" They are organized in a lattice to form clusters in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The spatial arrangement of RyR2s within clusters strongly influences the frequency of Ca2+ sparks (Walker et al. 2015). Structures of RyR2 from porcine heart in both the open and closed states at near atomic resolutions have been determined using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (Peng et al. 2016). Structural comparisons revealed breathing motions of the overall cytoplasmic region resulting from the interdomain movements of amino-terminal domains (NTDs), Helical domains, and Handle domains, whereas little intradomain shifts are observed in these armadillo repeat-containing domains. Outward rotations of the central domains, which integrate the conformational changes of the cytoplasmic region, lead to the dilation of the cytoplasmic gate through coupled motions. These observations provide insight into the gating mechanism of RyRs (Peng et al. 2016). RyR2 is subject ot regulation by cytoplasmic Zn2+ (>1nM), and this regulation plays a key role in diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage in cardiac muscle (Reilly-O'Donnell et al. 2017). Ryanodine receptor-mediated SR Ca2+ efflux is apparently balanced by concomitant counterion currents across the SR membrane (Sanchez et al. 2018). Electrical polarity-dependent gating and a unique subconductance of RyR2 is induced by S-adenosyl methionine via the ATP binding site. Thus, SAM may alter the conformation of the RyR2 ion conduction pathway (Kampfer and Balog 2021).","2":"PBDID: 4JKQ  PBDID: 6Y4O  PBDID: 6Y4P"},{"0":"1.A.3.1.2","1":"The Ryanodine receptor Ca2+\/K+ release tetrameric channel, RyR1, present in skeletal muscle, is 5038 aas long.

RyR1 interacts with CLIC2 to modulate its channel activity (Meng et al., 2009). A model pf RyR1 has been constructed encompassing the six transmembrane helices to calculate the RyR1 pore region conductance, to analyze its structural stability, and to hypothesize the mechanism of the Ile4897 CCD-associated mutation. The calculated conductance of the wild-type RyR1 suggests that the pore structure can sustain ion currents measured in single-channel experiments.\u00a0Shirvanyants et al. 2014 observed a stable pore structure with multiple cations occupying the selectivity filter and cytosolic vestibule, but not the inner chamber. Stability of the selectivity filter depends on interactions between the I4897 residue and several hydrophobic residues of the neighboring subunit. Loss of these interactions in the case of the polar substitution, I4897T, results in destabilization of the selectivity filter, a possible cause of the CCD-specific reduced Ca2+ conductance. A 4.8 \u00c5 structure of the rabbit orthologue in the closed state of this 2.3 MDa tetramer (3757 aas\/protomer) reveals the pore, the VIC superfamily fold and a potential mechanism of Ca2+ gating (Zalk et al. 2015). A cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed the structure at 6.1 \u00c5 resolution (Efremov et al. 2015). The transmembrane domain represents a chimaera of voltage-gated sodium and pH-activated ion channels. They identified the calcium-binding EF-hand domain and showed that it functions as a conformational switch, allosterically gating the channel. Malignant hyperthermia-associated RyR1 mutations in the S2-S3 loop confer RyR2-type Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent channel regulation (Gomez et al. 2016). Structural analyses have elucidated a novel channel-gating mechanism and a novel ion selectivity mechanism for RyR1 (Wei et al. 2016). Sams\u00f3 2016 reviewed structural determinations of RyR by cryoEM and analyzed the first near-atomic structures, revealing a complex orchestration of domains controlling channel function. The structural basis for gating and activation have been determined (des Georges et al. 2016). Junctin and triadin bind to different sites on RyR1; triadin plays an important role in ensuring rapid Ca2+ release during excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. RyR1 structure\/functioin has been reviewed (Zalk and Marks 2017). Possibly, luminal Ca2+ activates RyR1 by accessing a cytosolic Ca2+ binding site in the open channel as the Ca2+ ions pass through the pore (Xu et al. 2017). The 3-d structures of the native protein in membranes has been determined (Chen and Kudryashev 2020) (see family description).

Mg2+ ions are present in the cytosolic domain that are well placed to control the interaction of the ring of positive charge and the negatively charged helices, and thus, control Mg2+ entry (Maguire 2006). Gating is achieved by helical rotation upon the binding of a metal ion  substrate to the regulatory binding sites.

The channel may have a large internal chamber surrounded by signal sensing antennas (Mio et al. 2007). TRPC channels are involved in store-operated calcium entry and calcium homeostasis, and they are implicated in human diseases such as neurodegenerative disease, cardiac hypertrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxia (Fan et al. 2018). The structure in a lipid-occupied, closed state has been solved at 3.3 \u00c5 resolution. TRPC3 has four elbow-like membrane reentrant helices prior to the first transmembrane helix. The TRP helix is perpendicular to, and thus disengaged from, the pore-lining S6, suggesting a different gating mechanism from other TRP subfamily channels. The third transmembrane helix S3 is remarkably long, shaping a unique transmembrane domain, and constituting an extracellular domain that may serve as a sensor of external stimuli. Fan et al. 2018 identified two lipid binding sites, one being sandwiched between the pre-S1 elbow and the S4-S5 linker, and the other being close to the ion-conducting pore, where the conserved LWF motif of the TRPC family is located. The cytoplasmic domain allosterically modulates channel gating (Sierra-Valdez et al. 2018). This channel may be present in mitochondria (Parrasia et al. 2019).

The structure shows a two-layer architecture in which the bell-shaped cytosolic layer holds the transmembrane layer. Extensive inter-subunit interactions of cytosolic domains, including the N-terminal ankyrin repeats and the C-terminal coiled-coil, contribute to the tetramer assembly. The high-affinity inhibitor BTDM wedges between the S5-S6 pore domain and voltage sensor-like domain to inhibit channel opening (Tang et al. 2018). TRPC6 may regulate the glomerular filtration rate by modulating mesangial cell contractile function through multiple Ca2+ signaling pathways (Li et al. 2017).

TRPV1 mediates an itch associated response (Kim et al., 2011). The thermosensitive TRP channel pore turret is part of the temperature activation apparatus (Yang et al., 2010). Modular thermal sensors in temperature-gated transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been identified (Yao et al., 2011). TRPV1 opening is associated with major structural rearrangements in the outer pore, including the pore helix and selectivity filter, as well as pronounced dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the lower gate, suggesting a dual gating mechanism (Cao et al. 2013). Allosteric coupling between upper and lower gates may account for modulation exhibited by TRPV1 and other TRP channels (Liao et al. 2013). TRPV1 regulates longevity and metabolism by neuropeptides in mice (Riera et al. 2014). The pore of TRPV1 contains the structural elements sufficient for activation by noxious heat (Zhang et al. 2017). In bull sperm, TRPV1 functions in the regulation of motility and the acrosome reaction (Kumar et al. 2019). The dynamics of water in the transmembrane pore of TRPV1 have been studied (Trofimov et al. 2019). TRPV1 - 6 channel subunits do not combine arbitrarily. With the exception of TRPV5 and TRPV6, TRPV channel subunits preferentially assemble into homomeric complexes (Hellwig et al. 2005). TrpV1-gated ion channels have been used as sensors for imaging applications (Zhu et al. 2021). Capsaicin and protons differently modulate the activation kinetics of the mouse TrpV1 channel induced by depolarization (Takahashi et al. 2021). The impact of TRPV1 on cancer pathogenesis and therapy has been reviewed (Li et al. 2021). TRPV1 may be an analgesic target for patients experiencing pain after oral irradiation (Lai et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 2NYJ  PBDID: 2PNN  PBDID: 3J5P  PBDID: 3J5Q  PBDID: 3J5R  PBDID: 3SUI  PBDID: 3J9J  PBDID: 5irx  PBDID: 5IRZ  PBDID: 5IS0"},{"0":"1.A.4.2.10","1":"TRPV5 epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC1) (forms homo- and heterotetrameric channels with TRPV6; requires the S100A10-annexin 2 complex for routing to the plasma membrane) (Hoenderop et al., 2003; van de Graaf et al., 2003). The kidney maintains whole body calcium homoeostasis due to the reabsorption of Ca2+ filtered by the kidney glomerulus. TRPV5 regulates urinary Ca2+ excretion by mediating active Ca2+ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. The histidine kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPK-B), activates TRPV5 channel activity and Ca2+ flux, and this activation requires histidine 711 in the carboxy terminal tail of TRPV5. In addition, the histidine phosphatase, protein histidine phosphatase 1 (PHPT1), inhibits NDPK-B activated TRPV5 (Cai et al. 2014). TRPV5 also transports cadmium (Cd2+). The L530R mutation is associated with recurrent kidney stones (Wang et al. 2017). May be stabilized by Mucin-1 (Muc1; P15941) (Al-Bataineh et al. 2017).

Epithelial TrpV6, but not TrpV5, is inhibited by the regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2; Q9JHX0; 211 aas) by direct binding (Schoeber et al., 2006). Calmodulin (CaM) positively affects TRPV6 activity upon Ca2+ binding to EF-hands 3 and 4, located in the high Ca2+ affinity CaM C-terminus (Lambers et al. 2004). Cyclophilin B is an accessory activating protein (Stumpf et al., 2008). The crystal structure of rat TRPV6 at 3.25 A resolution revealed shared and unique features compared with other TRP channels (Saotome et al. 2016). Intracellular domains engage in extensive interactions to form an intracellular 'skirt' involved in allosteric modulation. In the K+ channel-like transmembrane domain, Ca2+ selectivity is determined by direct coordination of Ca2+ by a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter (Saotome et al. 2016). Replacing Gly-516 within the cytosolic S4-S5 linker (conserved in all TRP channel proteins) by ser forces the channels into an open conformation, thereby enhancing constitutive Ca2+ entry and preventing inactivation (Hofmann et al. 2016). Tetrameric ion channels have either swapped or non-swapped arrangements of the S1-S4 and pore domains.\u00a0Singh et al. 2017 showed that mutations in the transmembrane domain can result in conversion from a domain-swapped to the non-swapped fold. These results raise the possibility that a single ion channel subtype can fold into either arrangement in vivo, affecting its function in normal or disease states. Cryo-EM structures of human TRPV6 in the open and closed states shows that the channel selectivity filter adopts similar conformations in both states, consistent with its explicit role in ion permeation. The iris-like channel opening is accompanied by an alpha-to-pi-helical transition in the pore-lining transmembrane helix S6 at an alanine hinge just below the selectivity filter. As a result of this transition, the S6 helices bend and rotate, exposing different residues to the ion channel pore in the open and closed states (McGoldrick et al. 2017). TRPV6 is an epithelial Ca2+-selective channel associated with transient neonatal hyperparathyroidism (TNHP), an autosomal-recessive disease caused by TRPV6 mutations that affect maternal-fetal calcium transport (Suzuki et al. 2018). TRPV6 mediates calcium uptake in epithelia, and its expression increases in numerous types of cancer while inhibitors suppress tumor growth.\u00a0Singh et al. 2018 presented crystal and cryo-EM structures of human and rat TRPV6 bound to 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a TRPV6 inhibitor and modulator of numerous TRP channels. 2-APB binds to TRPV6 in a pocket formed by the cytoplasmic half of the S1-S4 transmembrane helix bundle. 2-APB induces TRPV6 channel closure by modulating protein-lipid interactions. The 2-APB binding site may be present in other members of vanilloid subfamily TRP channels. The crystal structure has been determined (see\u00a030299652 and Yelshanskaya et al. 2020). Novel mutations in TRPV6 give rise to the spectrum of transient neonatal hyperparathyroidism (Suzuki et al. 2020). TRPV6) plays roles in calcium absorption in epithelia and bone and is involved in human diseases including vitamin-D deficiency, osteoporosis, and cancer.\u00a0Cai et al. 2020 showed that the TRPV6 intramolecular S4-S5 linker to the C-terminal TRP helix (L\/C) and N-terminal pre-S1 helix to TRP helix (N\/C) interactions, mediated by Arg470:Trp593 and Trp321:Ile597 bonding, respectively, are autoinhibitory and are required for maintaining TRPV6 at basal states. Disruption of either interaction by mutations or blocking peptides activates TRPV6. The N\/C interaction depends on the L\/C interaction but not inversely. Three cationic residues in S5 or the C terminus are involved in binding PIP2 to suppress both interactions, thereby activating TRPV6 (Cai et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 6BO8  PBDID: 6BO9  PBDID: 6BOA  PBDID: 6D7S  PBDID: 6D7T  PBDID: 6E2F"},{"0":"1.A.4.2.13","1":"TrpV1 of 839 aas and ~ 6 TMSs.

TRPV1 channels are present in odontoblasts, suggesting that odontoblasts may directly respond to noxious stimuli such as a thermal-heat stimulus (Okumura et al. 2005). It may mediate proton influx and be involved in intracellular acidosis in nociceptive neurons. It is also involved in mediating inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia (Benemei et al. 2015). The 3.4 \u00c5 resolution structure shows that the overall fold is the same as for voltage-gated ion channels (TC# 1.A.1) (Liao et al. 2013). Capsaicin-induced apoptosis in glioma cells is mediated by TRPV1 (Amantini et al. 2007). Capsaicin binds to a pocket formed by the channel's TMSs, where it takes a \"\"tail-up, head-down\"\" configuration. Binding is mediated by both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Upon binding, capsaicin stabilizes the open state of TRPV1 by \"\"pull-and-contact\"\" with the S4-S5 linker (Yang and Zheng 2017). Several protein kinases, including PKD1 (protein kinase D1), Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) and LIMK (LIM- motif containing kinase) regulate TRPV1 and inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia (Zhang and Wang 2017). TrpV1 and TrpA1 are inflammatory mediators causing cutaneous chronic itch in several diseases (Xie and Li 2018). The locations and characteristics of volatile general anesthetic binding sites in the transmembrane domain of TRPV1 have been examined (Jorgensen and Domene 2018). The TRPV1 ion channel is a neuronal sensor that plays an important role in nociception and neuropathic as well as inflammatory pain. In clinical trials, hyperthermia and thermo-hypoaesthesia are major side effects of TRPV1 antagonists (Damann et al. 2020). The TRPV1 ion channel is a polymodal sensor integrating stimuli from molecular modulators with temperature, pH and transmembrane potential. Temperature-dependent gating may constitute the molecular basis for its role in heat sensation and body temperature regulation. Damann et al. 2020 characterized the prototypic small molecule TRPV1 inhibitors GRT12360V and GRTE16523. The oxidizing reagent copper-o-phenanthroline is an open channel blocker of TRPV1 (Tousova et al. 2004). Lack of TRPV1 aggravates obesity-associated hypertension through the disturbance of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in brown adipose tissue (Li et al. 2022). Lipoic\/Capsaicin-related amides are TRPV1 agonists endowed with protective properties against oxidative stress (Brizzi et al. 2022). Agonistic\/antagonistic properties of lactones in food flavors on the sensory ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPA1 have been reviewed (Ogawa et al. 2022).

Deleting the first N-terminal 74 residues preceding the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) shows a key role for this region in targeting the protein to the membrane. Co-translational insertion of the membrane-embedded region occurs with the TM1-TM4 and TM5-TM6 regions assembling as independent folding domains. ARD is not required for TM domain insertion into the membrane (Do\u00f1ate-Macian et al. 2015). The TRPV2 structure has been solved at 4 \u00c5 resolution by cryoEM (Zubcevic et al. 2016). Formation of a physical complex between mouse TRPV2 (GRC) and the mouse RGA protein promotes cell surface expression of TRPV2 (Stokes et al. 2005). The role of Ca2+ infllux via TRPV1 in cell death and survival related to cancer has been evaluated (Zhai et al. 2020). A helix-turn-helix motif for high temperature dependence of TRPV2 has been identified (Liu and Qin 2021). As noted above, TRPV2 is a ligand-operated temperature sensor.\u00a0Zhang et al. 2022 combined calcium imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology with cryo-EM to explore how  TRPV2 activity is modulated by the phytocannabinoid \u03949-tetrahydrocannabiorcol  (C16) and by probenecid. C16 and probenecid act in concert to stimulate  TRPV2 responses including histamine release from mast cells. Each ligand causes distinct conformational changes in TRPV2. Although the binding for probenecid remains elusive, C16 associates within the vanilloid pocket. As such, the C16 binding location is distinct from that of cannabidiol, partially overlapping with the binding site of the TRPV2 inhibitor piperlongumine (Zhang et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2F37"},{"0":"1.A.4.2.9","1":"The temperature (heat; >39\u00b0C)-sensitive, capsaicin-insensitive receptor cation-selective channel, TRPV3 or TRL3 (may form heterooligomers with VR1 (TRPV1; TC #1.A.4.2.1)). Incensole acetate, an incense component, elicits psychoactivity by activating TRPV3 channels in the brain (Moussaieff et al., 2008). TRPV3 is activated by synthetic small-molecule chemicals and natural compounds from plants as well as warm temperatures. Its function is regulated by a variety of physiological factors including extracellular divalent cations and acidic pH, intracellular ATP, membrane voltage, and arachidonic acid. It shows a broad expression pattern in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including epidermal keratinocytes, epithelial cells in the gut, endothelial cells in blood vessels, and neurons in dorsal root ganglia and the CNS. TRPV3 null mice exhibit abnormal hair morphogenesis and compromised skin barrier function, and it may play critical roles in inflammatory skin disorders, itch, and pain sensation (Luo and Hu 2014). TRPV3 gating involves large rearrangements at the cytoplasmic inter-protomer interface, and this motion triggers coupling between cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, priming the channel for opening (Zubcevic et al. 2019). Mutations in TRPV3 cause painful focal plantar keratoderma (Peters et al. 2020). TRPV3 is a temperature-sensitive, nonselective cation channel expressed prominently in skin keratinocytes that plays important roles in hair morphogenesis and maintenance of epidermal barrier function. Mechanisms of proton inhibition and sensitization have been discussed (Wang et al. 2021). Mechanisms of proton inhibition and sensitization of TRPV3 have been considered (Wang et al. 2021). TRPV3 is predominantly expressed in skin keratinocytes and has been implicated in cutaneous sensation and associated with numerous skin pathologies and cancers. TRPV3 is inhibited by the natural coumarin derivative osthole, an active ingredient of Cnidium monnieri, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various human diseases.\u00a0Neuberger et al. 2021 presented cryo-EM structures of TRPV3 in complex with osthole, revealing two types of osthole binding sites in the transmembrane region of TRPV3 that coincide with the binding sites of agonist 2-APB. Osthole binding converts the channel pore into a previously unidentified conformation with a widely open selectivity filter and closed intracellular gate.

Calcium-activated non selective cation channel that mediates membrane depolarization. While it is activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, it is impermeable to it. It does mediate transport of monovalent cations (Na+ > K+ > Cs+ > Li+),  leading to depolarize the membrane. It thereby plays a central role in the function of cardiomyocytes, neurons from entorhinal cortex, dorsal root and vomeronasal neurons, endocrine pancreas cells, kidney epithelial cells, cochlea hair cells etc. It also participates in T-cell activation by modulating Ca2+ oscillations after T lymphocyte activation (Demion et al. 2007). The structure has been determined by cryo EM both with and without ATP (Guo et al. 2017). It consists of multiple transmembrane and cytosolic domains, which assemble into a three-tiered architecture. The N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain and the C-terminal coiled-coil participate in the tetrameric assembly of the channel; ATP binds at the nucleotide-binding domain to inhibit channel activity. TRPM4 has an exceptionally wide filter although it is only permeable to monovalent cations; filter residue Gln973 is essential in defining monovalent selectivity. The S1-S4 domain and the post-S6 TRP domain form the central gating apparatus that probably houses the Ca2+- and PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding sites (Guo et al. 2017). TRPM4 currents are activated by micromolar concentrations of cytoplasmic Ca2+and progressively desensitized. Zhang et al. 2005 showed that desensitization can be explained by a loss of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) from the channels. TrpM4 interacts directly with glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels (NMDARs) to promote excitotoxicity. Small-molecule interface inhibitors prevent NMDAR-TRPM4 physical coupling and eliminate excitotoxicity.

Autzen et al. 2018 presented two structures of full-length human TRPM4 embedded in lipid nanodiscs at ~3-angstrom resolution, as determined by  single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures, with and without calcium bound, reveal the general architecture for this major subfamily of TRP channels and a well-defined calcium-binding site within  the intracellular side of the S1-S4 domain. The structures correspond to two distinct closed states. Calcium binding induces conformational changes that likely prime the channel for voltage-dependent opening (Autzen et al. 2018). TRPM4 functions as a limiting factor for antigen evoked calcium rise in connective tissue type mast cells, and concurrent translocation of TRPM4 into the plasma membrane is part of this mechanism (Rixecker et al. 2016). Gain-of-function mutations in the TRPM4 activation gate caused progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (Wang et al. 2018).

It transports Ca2+ and Mg2+ with equal facility (Xia et al., 2008). Four Ca2+ ions activate TRPM2 channels by binding in deep crevices near the pore but intracellularly of the gate (Csan\u00e1dy and T\u00f6rocsik, 2009). Protons also regulate activity (Starkus et al., 2010). It is present in the plasma membrane and lysosomes, and plays a role in ROS-induced inflammatory processes and cell death. Melastatin is required for innate immunity against Listeria\u00a0monocytogenes\u00a0(Knowles et al., 2011). It functions in pathogen-evoked phagocyte activation, postischemic neuronal apoptosis, and glucose-evoked insulin secretion, by linking these cellular responses to oxidative stress (T\u00f3th and Csan\u00e1dy, 2012). Pore collapse upon prolonged stimulation underlies irreversible inactivation (T\u00f3th and Csan\u00e1dy 2012). TRPM2 is preferentially expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage and modulates signaling pathways converging into NF-kB but does not seem to play a major role in myeloid leukemogenesis. Its loss does not augment the cytotoxicity of standard AML chemotherapeutic agents (Haladyna et al. 2016). TrpM2, expressed in hypothalamic neurons in the brain is a thermosensitive, redox-sensitive channel, required for thermoregulation. It regulates body temperature, limiting fever and driving hypothermia (Song et al. 2016). Tseng et al. 2016 suggested a mechanistic link between TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ influx and p47 phox signaling to induce excess ROS production and TXNIP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation under high gllucose in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus. The cryoEM strcuture reveals a C-terminal NUDT9 homology (NUDT9H) domain responsible for binding ADP-ribose(ADPR) (Wang et al. 2018). Both ADPR and Ca2+ are required for TRPM2 activation, and structures with ADPR and Ca2+ show both intra- and inter-subunit interactions with the N-terminal TRPM homology region (MHR1\/2\/3) in the apo state, but undergoing conformational changes upon ADPR binding, resulting in rotation of MHR1\/2 and disruption of the inter-subunit interaction. Ca2+ binding further engages transmembrane helices and the conserved TRP helix to cause conformational changes at the MHR arm and the lower gating pore to potentiate channel opening (Wang et al. 2018). Consecutive structural rearrangements and channel activation are induced by binding of ADPR in two indispensable locations, and the binding of Ca2+ in the transmembrane domain (Huang et al. 2019). An N-terminal TRPC2 splice variant of 213 aas inhibits calcium influx (Chu et al. 2005). An antogonists of channel function has been identified (Cruz-Torres et al. 2020).

Protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of TRPM2 Thr738 counteracts the effect of cytosolic Ca2+ and elevates the temperature threshold (Kashio et al. 2022). Citronellal suppresses the expression of NHE1 and TPRM2, alleviates oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage, and imposes a protective effect on endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats (Yin et al. 2022).

Noxious compounds also activate through covalent modification of cysteyl residues (Macpherson et al., 2007). TRPA1 is an excitatory, nonselective cation channel implicated in somatosensory function, pain, and neurogenic inflammation. Through covalent modification of cysteine and lysine residues, TRPA1 can be activated by electrophilic compounds, including active ingredients of pungent natural products (e.g., allyl isothiocyanate), environmental irritants (e.g., acrolein), and endogenous ligands (4-hydroxynonenal) (Chen et al., 2008). General anesthetics activate TRPA1 nociceptive ion channels to enhance pain and inflammation (Matta et al., 2008; Leffler et al., 2011). TMS5 is a critical molecular determinant of menthol sensitivity (Xiao et al., 2008) and a variety of inhibitors which are analgesics. Another class of inhibitors are in the thiadiazole structural class of compounds, and they bind to the TRPA1 ankyrin repeat 6 (Tseng et al. 2018). Inhibitors are potential analgesics. The majority of TRPA1 inhibitors interact with the S5 transmembrane helices, forming part of the pore region of the channel. TRPA1 is a component of the nociceptive response to CO2 (Wang et al., 2010).\u00a0TRPA1 is a polyunsaturated fatty acid sensor in mammals but not in flies and fish (Motter and Ahern, 2012). It is regulated by its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (Zayats et al., 2012). Mutations in TrpA1 cause alterred pain perception (Kremeyer et al. 2010). The hop compound, eudesmol, an oxygenated sesquiterpene, activates the channel (Ohara et al. 2015). These channels regulate heat and cold perception, mechanosensitivity, hearing, inflammation, pain, circadian rhythms, chemoreception, and other processes (Laursen et al. 2014). TRPA1 is a polymodal ion channel sensitive to temperature and chemical stimuli, but its resposes are species specific (Laursen et al. 2015). A probable binding site for general anesthetics has been identified (Ton et al. 2017), and specific residues involved in binding of the anesthetic, propofol, are known (Woll et al. 2017). TrpV1 and TrpA1 are inflammatory mediators causing cutaneous chronic itch in several diseases (Xie and Li 2018). TRPA1 is specifically activated by natural products including allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon), allicin (garlic) and trans-anethole in Fennel Oil (FO) (Memon et al. 2019). Mutations in TRPA1 result in insensitivity to pain promoting algogens such as capsaicin, acid, and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), have been documented (Eigenbrod et al. 2019). TRPA1 transduces noxious chemical stimuli into nociceptor electrical excitation and neuropeptide release, leading to pain and neurogenic inflammation. It is regulated by the membrane environment. Startek et al. 2019 found that mouse TRPA1 localizes to cholesterol-rich domains, and that cholesterol depletion decreases channel sensitivity to chemical agonists. Two structural motifs in TMSs 2 and 4 are involved in cholesterol interactions that are necessary for normal agonist sensitivity and plasma membrane localization. TRPA1 is an irritant sensor and a therapeutic target for treating pain, itch, and respiratory diseases. It can be activated by electrophilic compounds such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). A class of piperidine carboxamides (PIPCs) are potent noncovalent agonists (Chernov-Rogan et al. 2019). Saikosaponins are channel antogonists (Lee et al. 2019). hTRPA1 is activated by electrophiles such as N-methyl maleimide (NMM). A conformational switch of the protein, possibly associated with activation or desensitization of the ion channel, involves covalent derivatization of several cysteyl and lysyl residues in the transmembrane domain and the proximal N-terminal region as targets for electrophilic activation (Moparthi et al. 2020). Altering expression of the genes encoding Kv1.1, Piezo2, and TRPA1 regulate the response of mechanosensitive muscle nociceptors (Nagaraja et al. 2021). As a polymodal nocisensor, TRPA1 can be activated by thermal and mechanical stimuli as well as a wide range of chemically damaging molecules including small volatile environmental toxicants and endogenous algogenic lipids (Zsid\u00f3 et al. 2021). After activation by such compounds, the ion channel opens up, allowing calcium influx into the cytosol, inducing signal transduction pathways. Then, calcium influx desensitizes irritant evoked responses and results in an inactive state of the ion channel. It was shown how reversible interactions with binding sites contribute to structural changes of TRPA1, leading to covalent bonding of agonists (Zsid\u00f3 et al. 2021). The binding site(s) for antagonists have been determined for the TRPA1 ion channel (Gawalska et al. 2022). The hTRPA1 C-terminial domain (CTD) harbors cold and heat sensitive domains allosterically coupled to the S5-S6 pore region and the VSLD, respectively (Moparthi et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 3J9P  PBDID: 6HC8  PBDID: 6PQO  PBDID: 6PQP  PBDID: 6PQQ  PBDID: 6V9V  PBDID: 6V9W  PBDID: 6V9X  PBDID: 6V9Y"},{"0":"1.A.40.1.1","1":"The ion channel viral protein U, Vpu of 81 aas and 1 TMS.

The mutation A18H converts a non-specific channel to a selective proton channel that is sensitive to rimantadine (Sharma et al., 2011). Vpu forms stable pentamers (Padhi et al. 2013). The mechanism of Vpu, a weakly conducting cation-selective channel that assists in detachment of the virion from infected cells, has been proposed (Padhi et al. 2014). Interactions of Vpu with host cellular constituents have been reviewed (Gonz\u00e1lez 2015). Vpu forms large homo aggregates of 16 or 32 subunits (Lin et al. 2016). Vpu is involved in the enhancement of virion release via formation of an ion channel. Cyclohexamethylene amiloride (Hma) inhibits ion channel activity. A putative binding site for Hma blockers in a pentameric model bundle built of parallel aligned helices of the first 32 residues of Vpu was found near Ser-23. Hma orientates along the channel axis with its alkyl ring pointing inside the pore, which leads to a blockage of the pore (Lemaitre et al. 2004).","2":"PBDID: 2N29"},{"0":"1.A.42.1.1","1":"Vpr of HIV of 96 aas and one TM","2":"PBDID: 1BDE  PBDID: 1DSJ  PBDID: 1DSK  PBDID: 1KZS  PBDID: 1KZT  PBDID: 1KZV  PBDID: 5JK7"},{"0":"1.A.43.1.17","1":"Fluoride ion channel of 128 aas and 4 TMSs, Fluc or CrcB.

Ca2+ binds to the channel's large cytosolic region. A single ion pore, approximately 95 \u00c5 in length, is located along the central axis and contains at least 15 binding sites for anions. A hydrophobic neck within the pore probably forms the gate. Phenylalanine residues within it may coordinate permeating anions via anion-\u03c0 interactions.

The C-terminal coiled-coil complex is critical for proper assembly (Zhu et al., 2011). Missense mutations have been identified that affect membrane topogenesis (Nims et al. 2011). Biomarkers for polycystic kidney diseases have been identified (Hogan et al. 2015). Extracellular divalent ions, including Ca2+, inhibit permeation of monovalent ions by directly blocking the TRPP2 channel pore. D643, a negatively charged amino acid in the pore, is crucial for channel permeability (Arif Pavel et al. 2016). Polycystin (TRPP\/PKD) complexes, made of transient receptor potential channel polycystin (TRPP)4 and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) proteins, play key roles in coupling extracellular stimuli with intracellular Ca2+ signals. PKD1 and PKD2 form a complex, the structure of which has been solved in 3-dimensions at high resolution. The complex consists of PKD1:PKD2 = 3:1. PKD1 consists of a voltage-gated ion channel fold that interacts with PKD2 to complete a domain-swapped TRP architecture with unique features (Su et al. 2018; Su et al. 2018). The C-terminal tail of PKD1 may play a role in the prognosis of renal disease (Higashihara et al. 2018). TRPP2 uses 2 gating charges found in its fourth TMS (S4) to control its conductive state (Ng et al. 2019). Rosetta structural predictions demonstrated that the S4 undergoes approximately 3- to 5-\u00c5 transitional and lateral movements during depolarization coupled to opening of the channel pore. Both gating charges form state-dependent cation-pi interactions within the voltage sensor domain (VSD) during membrane depolarization. The transfer of a single gating charge per channel subunit is required for voltage, temperature, and osmotic swell polymodal gating. Thus, TRPP2 channel opening is dependent on activation of its VSDs (Ng et al. 2019). Polycystin-1 assembles with Kv channels to govern cardiomyocyte repolarization and contractility (Altamirano et al. 2019). Three-dimensional in vitro models answer questions about ADPKD cystogenesis (Dixon and Woodward 2018). The polycystin-1 subunit directly contributes to the channel pore, and its eleven TMSs are sufficient for its channel function (Wang et al. 2019). Polycystin-1 inhibits cell proliferation through phosphatase PP2A\/B56alpha (Tang et al. 2019). Polycystin-1 regulates cardiomyocyte mitophagy (Ram\u00edrez-Sagredo et al. 2021). Maser and Calvet 2020 reviewed  structural and functional features shared by polycystin-1 and the adhesion GPCRs (TC# 9.A.14.6.2) and discussed the implications of such  similarities for our understanding of the functions of these proteins. Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Polycystins are expressed in the primary cilium, and disrupting cilia structure slows ADPKD progression following inactivation of polycystins. Dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is an early driver of cyst cell proliferation in ADPKD due to Pkd1 inactivation (Zhang et al. 2021). Genetic removal of c-Jun N-terminal kinases, Jnk1 and Jnk2, suppresses the nuclear accumulation of phospho c-Jun, reduces proliferation and reduces the severity of cystic disease. While Jnk1 and Jnk2 are thought to have largely overlapping functions, Jnk1 loss is nearly as effective as the double loss of Jnk1 and Jnk2 (Smith et al. 2021). Polycystic kidney disease (PKD), comprising autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), is characterized by incessant cyst formation in the kidney and liver. ADPKD and ARPKD represent the leading genetic causes of renal disease in adults and children, respectively. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 encoding polycystin1 (PC1) and PKD2 encoding polycystin 2 (PC2). PC1\/2 are multi-pass transmembrane proteins that form a complex localized in the primary cilium. Predominant ARPKD cases are caused by mutations in polycystic kidney (Ma 2021). The mechanism of tethered agonist-mediated signaling by polycystin-1 has been investigated (Pawnikar et al. 2022). PC1 is an 11 TMS protein encoded by the PKD1 gene. It has a complex posttranslational maturation process, with over five proteolytic cleavages, and is found at multiple cellular locations. The initial description of the binding and activation of heterotrimeric Galphai\/o by the juxtamembrane region of the PC1 cytosolic C-terminal tail (C-tail) opened the door tothe possibility of potential functions as a novel G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Subsequent assays supported an ability of the PC1 C-tail to bind numerous members of the Galpha protein family and to either inhibit or activate G protein-dependent pathways involved in the regulation of ion channel activity, transcription factor activation, and apoptosis. PC1-mediated G protein regulation prevents kidney cyst development. Similarities between PC1 and the adhesion class of 7-TMS GPCRs, most notably a conserved GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) before the first TM domain, which undergoes autocatalyzed proteolytic cleavage, suggest potential mechanisms for PC1-mediated regulation of G protein signaling. reviewed the evidence supporting GPCR-like functions of PC1 and their relevance to cystic disease, discusses the involvement of GPS cleavage and potential ligands in regulating PC1 GPCR function, and explores potential connections between PC1 GPCR-like activity and regulation of the channel properties of the polycystin receptor-channel complex (Maser et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1B4R  PBDID: 6A70"},{"0":"1.A.5.1.3","1":"Heteromeric polycystic kidney disease proteins 1 and 2-like 1 (PKD1L1\/PKD2L1) cation (calcium) channel of kidney primary cilia (DeCaen et al. 2013).

Unlike its ortholog PKD2, the pore helix and TMS6, which are involved in upper and lower-gate opening, adopt an open conformation.

It has 8 TMSs with 6 TMSs in the channel domain with N- and C- termini inside (Hoffmeister et al., 2010). PC2 interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) to modulate Ca2+ signaling (Li et al. 2009). The PKD2 voltage-sensor domain retains two of four gating charges commonly found in voltage-gated ion channels. The PKD2 ion permeation pathway is constricted at the selectivity filter near the cytoplasmic end of S6, suggesting that two gates regulate ion conduction (Shen et al. 2016). 15% of cases of polycystic kidney disease result from mutations in the gene encoding this protein, while 85% are in PKD1 (Ghata and Cowley 2017). Topological changes between the closed and open sub-conductance states of the functional channel are observed with an inverse correlation between conductance and height of the channel. Intrinsic PC2 mechanosensitivity in response to external forces was also observed (Lal et al. 2018). PC2 is present in ciliary membranes of the kidney and shares a transmembrane fold with other TRP channels as well as an extracellular domain found in TRPP and TRPML channels.\u00a0Wang et al. 2019 characterized the phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2) and cholesterol interactions with PC2. PC2 has a PIP binding site close to the equivalent vanilloid\/lipid binding site in the TRPV1 channel and a binding site for cholesterol. The two classes of lipid binding sites were compared with sites observed in other TRPs and in Kv channels, suggesting that PC2, in common with other ion channels, may be modulated by both PIPs and cholesterol (Wang et al. 2019).

TRPML1 is an endolysosomal iron release channel (Dong et al., 2008). It interacts with TMEM163, a CDF heavy metal transporter (TC# 2.A.4.8.3). Together these proteins function in Zn2+ homeostasis, possibly by exporting Zn2+ (Cuajungco et al. 2014). The MLIV disease could result from Zn2+ overload. TrpML1 is probably involved in Zn2+ uptake into lysosomes (Cuajungco and Kiselyov 2017). Asp residues within the luminal pore may control calcium\/pH regulation. A synthetic agonist, ML-SA1, can bind to the pore region to force a direct dilation of the lower gate (Schmiege et al. 2018).

In spite of extensive experimental evidence, suggesting a pore size of 2.2\u00a0\u00c5, the conclusion of ion channel activity for phospholamban has been questioned (Maffeo and Aksimentiev 2009). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). This cyclic mechanism constitutes the driving force for calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm into the myocyte lumen, regulating cardiac contractility. PLN undergoes a conformational transition between a relaxed (R) and tense (T) state, an equilibrium perturbed by the addition of SERCA. Phosphoryl transfer to Ser16 induces a conformational switch to the R state. The binding affinity of PLN to SERCA is not affected ((Kd ~ 60 \u03bcM). However, the binding surface and dynamics in domain Ib (residues 22-31) change substantially upon phosphorylation. Since PLN can be singly or doubly phosphorylated at Ser16 and Thr17, these sites may remotely control the conformation of domain Ib (Traaseth et al. 2006). Phospholamban interests with SERCA with conformational memory (Smeazzetto et al. 2017). Under physiological conditions, PLB phosphorylation induces little or no change in the interaction of the TMS with SERCA, so relief of inhibition is predominantly due to the structural shift in the cytoplasmic domain (Martin et al. 2018). The phospholamban pentamer alters the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, SERCA (Glaves et al. 2019). PLB phosphorylation serves as an allosteric molecular switch that releases inhibitory contacts and strings together the catalytic elements required for SERCA activation (Aguayo-Ortiz and Espinoza-Fonseca 2020).","2":"PBDID: 1K9N  PBDID: 1KCH  PBDID: 1PLN  PBDID: 1PLP  PBDID: 1PSL  PBDID: 1ZLL  PBDID: 2HYN"},{"0":"1.A.50.2.1","1":"Sarcolipin (SLN) anion pore-forming protein of 31 aas and 1 TMS, with selectivity for Cl- and H2PO4-.

Sarcolipin, but not phospholamban, promotes uncoupling of the SERCA pump (3.A.3.2.7; Sahoo et al. 2013). SNL forms pentameric pores that can transport water, H+, Na+, Ca2+ and Cl-. Leu21 serves as the gate (Cao et al. 2015). In the channel, water molecules near the Leu21 pore demonstrated a clear hydrated-dehydrated transition (Cao et al. 2016). Small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1; TC#8.A.28.1.2) and SLN interact with each other in their transmembrane domains to regulate SERCA (TC# 3.A.3.2.7) (Desmond et al. 2017).

Thr29 is a phosphorylation site that activates the HVCN1 channel in leukocytes (Musset et al., 2010). The condctivity pore has been delineated and depends of a carboxyl group (Asp or Glu) in the channel (Morgan et al. 2013). The four transmembrane helices sense voltage and the pH gradient, and conduct protons exclusively. Selectivity is achieved by the unique ability of H3O+ to protonate an Asp-Arg salt bridge. Pathognomonic sensitivity of gating to the pH gradient ensures HV1 channel opening only when acid extrusion will result, which is crucial to its biological functions (DeCoursey 2015). An exception occurs in dinoflagellates (see 1.A.51.1.4) in which H+ influx through HV1 triggers a bioluminescent flash. The gating mechanism of Hv1, cooperativity within dimers and the sensitivity to metal ions have been reviewed (Okamura et al. 2015). How this channel is activated by cytoplasmic [H+] and depolarization of the membrane potential has been proposed by Castillo et al. 2015. The extracellular ends of the first transmembrane segments form the intersubunit interface that mediates coupling between binding sites, while the coiled-coil domain does not directly participate in the process (Hong et al. 2015). Deep water penetration through hHv1 has been observed, suggesting a highly focused electric field, comprising two helical turns along the fourth TMS. This region likely contains the H+ selectivity filter and the conduction pore. A 3D model offers an explicit mechanism for voltage activation based on a one-click sliding helix conformational rearrangement (Li et al. 2015). Trp-207 enables four characteristic properties: slow channel opening, highly temperature-dependent gating kinetics, proton selectivity, and \u0394pH-dependent gating (Cherny et al. 2015). The native Hv structure is a homodimer, with the two channel subunits functioning cooperatively (Okuda et al. 2016). Segment S3 plays a role in activating gating (Sakata et al. 2016). Two sites have been identified: one is the binding pocket of 2GBI (accessible to ligands from the intracellular side); the other is located at the exit site of the proton permeation pathway (Gianti et al. 2016). Crystal structures of Hv1 dimeric channels revealed that the primary contacts between the two monomers are in the C-terminal domain (CTD), which forms a coiled-coil structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of full-length and truncated CTD models revealed a strong contribution of the CTD to the packing of the TMSs (Boonamnaj and Sompornpisut 2018). Histidine-168 is essential for the \u0394pH-dependent gating (Cherny et al. 2018). Proton transfer in Hv1 utilizes a water wire, and does not require transient protonation of a conserved aspartate in the S1 transmembrane helix (Bennett and Ramsey 2017). Hv1 channels are present in bull spermatozoa, and these regulate sperm functions like hypermotility, capacitation and acrosome reaction through a complex interplay between different pathways involving cAMP, PKC, and Catsper (Mishra et al. 2019).

The transmembrane voltage sensor is connected to the phosphatase through a short linker region, and phosphatase activity is induced upon membrane depolarization (Zhang et al. 2018). The coupling between the two domains has been studied (Sakata et al. 2017). Membrane depolarization activates the phosphatase activity of the enzyme, presumably via electroconformational coupling between the sensor domain and the enzyme (Sanders and Hutchison 2018). Both the phosphatase domain and the C2 domain move with similar timing upon membrane depolarization (Sakata and Okamura 2018).

Replacement of the conserved glutamate in the first TMS with glutamine (E106Q) acts as a dominant-negative protein, and substitution with aspartate (E106D) enhances Na+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ permeation relative to Ca2+. Mutating E190Q in TMS3 also affects channel selectivity, suggesting that glutamate residues in both TMS1 and TMS3 face the lumen of the pore (Vig et al. 2006). The Orai1:Stim stoichiometry = 4:2 (Ji et al., 2008). Human Orai1 and Orai3 channels are dimeric in the closed resting state and open states. They are tetrameric when complexed with STIM1 (Demuro et al., 2011). A dimeric form catalyzes nonselective cation conductance in the STIM1-independent mode. STIM1 domains have been characterized (How et al. 2013). Alternative translation initiation of the Orai1 message produces long and short types of Ca2+ channels with distinct signaling and regulatory properties (Desai et al. 2015). STIM2 plays roles similar to STIM1 in regulating basal cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentrations by controling Orai1, 2 and 3. STIM2 may inhibit STIM1-mediated Ca2+ influx. It also regulates protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation and trafficking of AMPA receptors (TC# 1.A.10) (Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2015). A mechanistic model for ROS (H2O2)-mediated inhibition of Orai1 has been determined (Alansary et al. 2016). Regions that are important for the optimal assembly of hetero-oligomers composed of full-length STIM1 with its minimal STIM1-ORAI activating region, SOAR, have been identified (Ma et al. 2017). Orai1 may be multifunctional (Carrell et al. 2016). Activatioin of Orai1 requires communication between the N-terminus and loop 2 (Fahrner et al. 2017). STIM1 dimers unfold to expose a discrete STIM-Orai activating region (SOAR1) that tethers and activates Orai1 channels within discrete ER-PM junctions (Zhou et al. 2018). SOAR dimer cross-linking leads to substantial Orai1 channel clustering, resulting in increased efficacy and cooperativity of Orai1 channel function. In addition to being an ER Ca2+ sensor, STIM1 functions within the PM to exert control over the operation of SOCs. As a cell surface signaling protein, STIM1 represents a key pharmacological target to control fundamental Ca2+-regulated processes including secretion, contraction, metabolism, cell division, and apoptosis (Spassova et al. 2006). STIM1 also contributes to smooth muscle contractility (Feldman et al. 2017). STIM1-mediated Orai1 channel gating, involves bridges between TMS 1 and the surrounding TMSs 2\/3 ring, and these are critical for conveying the gating signal to the pore (Yeung et al. 2018). A review article summarizes the current high resolution structural data on specific EF-hand, sterile alpha motif and coiled-coil interactions which drive STIM function in the activation of Orai1 channels (Novello et al. 2018). Orai1 and STIM1 are involved in tubular aggregate myopathy (Wu et al. 2018). Knowledge of the structure-function relationships of CRAC channels, with a focus on key structural elements that mediate the STIM1 conformational switch and the dynamic coupling between STIM1 and ORAI1 has been discussed (Nguyen et al. 2018). While STIM1 is the native channel opener, a chemical modulator is 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (Ali et al. 2017). ORAI1 channel gating and selectivity iare differentially altered by natural mutations in the first and third transmembrane domains (Bulla et al. 2018). Stim1 responds to both ER Ca2+ depletion and heat, mediates temperature-induced Ca2+ influx in skin keratinocytes via coupling to Orai Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, and thereby brings about thermosensing (Liu et al. 2019). Possibly, the interplay between STIM1 alpha3 and Orai1 TM3 allows STIM1 coupling to be transmitted into physiological CRAC channel activation (Butorac et al. 2019). Blockage of store-operated Ca2+ influx by synta66 is mediated by direct inhibition of the Ca2+ selective orai1 pore (Waldherr et al. 2020). The carboxy terminal coiled-coil region modulates Orai1 internalization during meiosis (Hodeify et al. 2021). ORAI1 mutations disrupt channel trafficking, resulting in combined immunodeficiency (Yu et al. 2021). Orai channel C-terminal peptides are key modulators of STIM-Orai coupling and calcium signal generation (Baraniak et al. 2021). Conformational surveillance of Orai1 by a rhomboid intramembrane protease prevents inappropriate CRAC channel activation (Grieve et al. 2021). STIM1-dependent peripheral coupling governs the contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells (Krishnan et al. 2022). Gating checkpoints in the Orai1 calcium channel have been identified (Augustynek et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2K60  PBDID: 2MAJ  PBDID: 2MAK  PBDID: 3TEQ  PBDID: 4O9B  PBDID: 6YEL  PBDID: 2MAK  PBDID: 4EHQ  PBDID: 2L5Y"},{"0":"1.A.52.1.5","1":"Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel subunit, Orai, which mediates Ca2+ influx following depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. In Greek mythology, the 'Orai' are the keepers of the gates of heaven. The crystal structure (3.35 \u00c5), revealed a hexameric assembly of Orai subunits arranged around a central ion pore which traverses the membrane and extends into the cytosol. A ring of glutamate residues on its extracellular side forms the selectivity filter. A basic region near  the intracellular side can bind anions that may stabilize the closed state. The architecture of the channel differs from those of other solved ion channels (Hou et al. 2012). Residues in the third TMS of orai affect the conduction properties of the channel (Alavizargar et al. 2018); a conserved glutamate residue (E262) contributes to selectivity. Mutation of this residue affected the hydration pattern of the pore domain, and impaired selectivity of Ca2+ over Na+. The crevices of water molecules are located to contribute to the dynamics of the hydrophobic gate and the basic gate, suggesting a possible role in channel opening and in selectivity function (Alavizargar et al. 2018). The Orai channel is characterized by voltage independence, low conductance, and high Ca2+ selectivity and plays a role in Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane (PM).\u00a0Liu et al. 2019 reported the\u00a0crystal structure and cryo-EM reconstruction of a mutant (P288L) channel that is constitutively active. The open state showed a hexameric assembly in which 6 TMS 1 helices in the center form the ion-conducting pore, and 6 TMS 4 helices in the periphery form extended long helices. Orai channel activation requires conformational transduction from TM4 to TM1 and causes the basic section of TM1 to twist outward. The wider pore on the cytosolic side aggregates anions to increase the potential gradient across the membrane and thus facilitate Ca2+ permeation (Liu et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 4HKR  PBDID: 4HKS  PBDID: 6AKI  PBDID: 6BBF  PBDID: 6BBG  PBDID: 6BBH  PBDID: 6BBI"},{"0":"1.A.53.1.11","1":"Hepatitis GB virus B (GBV-B) polyprotein of 2864 aas, containing the p13 viroporin.

The trimeric channel (Eisses and Kaplan, 2005) forms an oligomeric pore with each subunit displaying 3 TMSs and 2 metal binding motifs (Lee et al., 2007). TMS2 is sufficient to form the trimer, and the MXXM motif bind Ag+ (Dong et al. 2015). Ctr1 mediates basolateral uptakes of Cu+ in enterocytes (Zimnicka et al., 2007) and shows copper-dependent internalization and recycling which provides a reversible mechanism for the regulation of cellular copper entry (Molloy and Kaplan, 2009). It acts as a receptor for the two extinct viruses, CERV1 and CERV2 (Soll et al., 2010). Ctr1 takes up platinum anticancer drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin (Du et al., 2012). The 3-d structure is known (Yang et al., 2012). Ctr1 has a low turn over number of about 10 ions\/second\/trimer (Maryon et al. 2013). Methionine and histidine residues in the transmembrane domain are essential for transport of copper, but when mutated, they stimulated uptake of cisplatin (Larson et al. 2010). Plays important roles in the developing embryo as well as in adult ionic homeostasis (Wee et al. 2013). (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major polyphenol from green tea, can enhance CTR1 mRNA and protein expression in ovarian cancer cells. EGCG inhibits the rapid degradation of CTR1 induced by cisplatin (cDDP). The combination of EGCG and cDDP increases the accumulation of cDDP and DNA-Pt adducts, and subsequently enhances the sensitivity of ovarian cancer (Wang et al. 2015). Steroid inhibitors may be able to overcome cycplatin resistance (Kadioglu et al. 2015). ctr1 is upregulated in colorectal cancer cells (Barresi et al. 2016). The N-terminus of CTR1 binds Cu2+ following transfer from blood copper carriers such as human serum albumin to the transporter (Bossak et al. 2018). Once in the cytosol, enzyme-specific chaperones receive copper from the CTR1 C-terminal domain and deliver it to their apoenzymes (Ilyechova et al. 2019). Ctr1 is part of the Sp1-Slc31a1\/Ctr1 copper-sensing system, and carnosine, a brain dipeptide, influences copper homeostasis in murine CNS-derived cells (Barca et al. 2019). A proteomic view of cellular responses of macrophages to copper has appeared (Dalzon et al. 2021). Tetrahedral framework nucleic acid delivered RNA therapeutics significantly attenuate pancreatic cancer progression via inhibition of CTR1-dependent copper absorption (Song et al. 2021). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has been used to study conformational changes during transport (Hofmann and Ruthstein 2022). Ctr1 is the main entry point for Cu' ions in eukaryotes. It contains intrinsically disordered regions, IDRs, both at its N-terminal (Nterm) and C-terminal ends. The former delivers copper ions from the extracellular matrix to the selectivity filter in the Ctr1 lumen.\u00a0Aupi\u00c4\u008d et al. 2022 showed that Cu+ ions and a lipidic environment drive the insertion of the N-terminus into the Ctr1 selectivity filter, causing its opening. Through a lipid-aided conformational switch of one of the transmembrane helices, the conformational change of the selectivity filter propagates down to the cytosolic gate of Ctr1.","2":"PBDID: 2LS2  PBDID: 2LS3  PBDID: 2LS4"},{"0":"1.A.59.1.1","1":"The pore-forming peptide, Pep46 (derived from the structural polyprotein (PP) precursor (1012 aas) (Galloux et al. 2007).

Cd2+ inhibits \u03b1-ENaC by binding to the internal pore where it interacts with residues in TMS2 (Takeda et al., 2007). The channel is regulated by palmitoylation of the beta subunit which modulates gating (Mueller et al. 2010). ENaCs are more selective for Naa+ over other cations than ASICs (Yang and Palmer 2018). ENaC plays a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (Zhao et al. 2014). The hetrodimeric complex can consist of \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 or \u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 subunits, depending on the tissue (Giraldez et al. 2012). The\u00a0\u03b1- and\u00a0\u03b3-subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel interact directly with the Na+:Cl- cotransporter, NCC, in the renal distal tubule with functional cosequences, and together they determine bodily salt balance and blood pressure (Mistry et al. 2016).

Each trimer subunit consists of seven TMSs with two inverted 3 TMS repeats (Silverio and Saier 2011). The electrophysiological, biochemical and biophysical analyses revealed that TRIC channels possess an ion-conducting pore within each subunit, and that trimer formation contributes to the stability of the protein. The symmetrically related TMS2 and TMS5 helices are kinked at conserved glycine clusters, and these kinks are important for channel activity. The kinks in TMS2 and TMS5 generate lateral fenestrations at each subunit interface that are occupied by lipid molecules (Kasuya et al. 2016). TRIC channels are involved in K+ uptake in prokaryotes, and have ion-conducting pores contained within each monomer.

A mutation in the encoding gene is associated with Parkinson's disease (Jing et al. 2015). It forms a potassium-permeable leak-like channel, which regulates lumenal pH stability and is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Lee et al. 2017). TMEM175 plays a direct and critical role in lysosomal and mitochondrial functions as well as Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis (Jinn et al. 2017). The 3-D structures of the open and closed channels are known (Oh et al. 2020). Coding variants in TMEM175 which increase the propensity for Parkinson's disease, are likely to be responsible for the association in the TMEM175\/GAK\/DGKQ locus, which could be mediated by affecting glucocerebrosidase activity (Krohn et al. 2020). It constitutes the major lysosomal potassium channel (Lee et al. 2017) and is the pore-forming subunit of the LysoK(GF) complex, a complex activated by extracellular growth factors (Wie et al. 2021). The LysoK(GF) complex is composed of TMEM175 and AKT (AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3). In the complex, the TMEM175 channel is opened by conformational changes in AKT, leading to its activation (Wie et al. 2021). The lysoK(GF) complex is required to protect neurons against stress-induced damage. Hydrophobic gating, exhibited by TMEM175, is the process by which a nanopore may spontaneously dewet to form a \"vapor lock\" if the pore is sufficiently hydrophobic and\/or narrow. This occurs without steric occlusion of the pore (Lynch et al. 2021). In addition to lysosomes, protein kinase B (PKB)-dependent regulation also influences TMEM175 currents in the plasma membrane (Pergel et al. 2021). Large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BK) and transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175) are the only two K+ channels known in lysosomes (Wu et al. 2022). Differential ion dehydration energetics explains selectivity in the non-canonical lysosomal K+channel, TMEM175 (Oh et al. 2022). 4-aminopyridine inhibits the lysosomal channel TMEM175 (Oh et al. 2022).

The highly conserved TM1 helix acts as the pore-lining inner helix, creating an hourglass-shaped ion permeation pathway in the channel tetramer. Three layers of hydrophobic residues on the carboxy-terminal half of the TM1 helices form a bottleneck along the ion conduction pathway and serve as the selectivity filter of the channel.

Aquaporin-1 tunes pain perception by interacting with Na(v)1.8 Na+ channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons (Zhang and Verkman, 2010). It is upregulated in skeletal muscle in muscular dystrophy (Au et al. 2008). AQP1 has been reported to first insert as a four-helical intermediate, where helices 2 and 4 are not inserted into the membrane. In a second step this intermediate is folded into a six-helical topology. During this process, the orientation of the third helix is inverted, and it can shift out the membrane core (Virkki et al. 2014). Its synthesis is regluated by Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2; Q9Y5W3) which also interacts directly with Aqp1 (Fontijn et al. 2015). A nanoscale ion pump has been derived artificially from Aqp1 (Decker et al. 2017). Mammalian AQP1 channels, activated by cyclic GMP, can carry non-selective monovalent cation currents, selectively blocked by arylsulfonamide compounds AqB007 (IC50 170 muM) and AqB011 (IC50 14 muM). Loop D-domain amino acids activate the channel for ion coductance (Kourghi et al. 2018). Water flux through AQP1s is inhibited by 1 - 10 m\u03bcM acetozolaminde (Gao et al. 2006). Aqp1 transports reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) which may induce oxidative stress in the cell interior. These RONS include both hydrophilic (H2O2 and OH) and hydrophobic (NO2 and NO) RONS (Yusupov et al. 2019). The position of the Arg-195 side chain shows a number of interactions for loop C (Dingwell et al. 2019). AQP1 play vital roles in cellular homeostasis at rest and during endurance running exercises (Rivera and Fahey 2019). AQP1 and AQP4 activities correlate with the severity of hydrocephalus induced by subarachnoid haemorrhage (Long et al. 2019). AQPs are related to osmoregulation and play a critical role in maturation, cryo-stability and motility activation in boar spermatozoa (Delgado-Berm\u00fadez et al. 2019). In foetal kidney, AQP1 expression appeared in the apical and basolateral parts of cells, lining the proximal convoluted tubules and the descending limb of Henle's loop, then in the tubule pole of Bowman's capsule (R\u00e1duly et al. 2019). Inhibition of aquaporin-1 prevents myocardial remodeling by blocking the transmembrane transport of hydrogen peroxide (Montiel et al. 2020). AQP1 Is up-regulated by hypoxia and leads to increased cell water permeability, motility, and migration in neuroblastoma (Huo et al. 2021). Aqp1 allows the transport of CO2 across membranes (Michenkova et al. 2021). Down-regulation of aquaporin-1 mediates a microglial phenotype switch affecting glioma growth (Hu et al. 2020). AQP1 expression is down-regulated following repeated exposure of UVB via MEK\/ERK activation pathways, and this AQP1 reduction leads to changes of physiological functions in dermal fibroblasts (Kim et al. 2020). AQP1 and AQP7 are differentially regulated under hyperosmotic stress conditions, and AQP1 acts as an osmotic stress sensor and response factor (Aggeli et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 1FQY  PBDID: 1H6I  PBDID: 1IH5  PBDID: 4CSK  PBDID: 6POJ"},{"0":"1.A.8.8.2","1":"The lens fiber MIP aquaporin (Aqp0) of B. taurus (forms membrane junctions in vivo and double layered crystals in vitro that resemble the in vivo junctions).

Forms human cataract lens membranes (Buzhynskyy et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2011). A mutation that causes congenital dominant lens cataracts has been identified (Varadaraj et al. 2008). AqpO catalyzes Zn2+-modulated water permeability as a cooperative tetramer (Nemeth-Cahalan et al., 2007). It transports ascorbic acid (Nakazawa et al., 2011). The Detergent organization around solubilized aquaporin-0 using Small Angle X-ray Scattering has been reported (Berthaud et al., 2012). Aquaporin 0 (AQP0) in the eye lens is truncated by proteolytic cleavage during lens maturation. This truncated AQP0 is no longer a water channel (Berthaud et al. 2015). A mutation that causes congenital dominant lens cataracts has been identified (Varadaraj et al. 2008). Cataractogenesis in MIP mutants are probably caused by defects in MIP gene expression in mice (Takahashi et al. 2017). This may be caused by the ability of Aqp0 (as well as Aqp1 and Aqp5) to transport hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which can cause cataracts (Varadaraj and Kumari 2020). An automated data processing and analysis pipeline for transmembrane proteins including Aqp0 in detergent solutions has been presented (Molodenskiy et al. 2020). EphA2 is required for normal Cx50 localization to the cell membrane, and  conductance of lens fiber cells requires normal Eph-ephrin signaling and water channel (Aqp0) localization (Cheng et al. 2021).

The longest, Aqp4e, has a novel N-terminal domain and forms a water channel in the plasma membrane although various shorter variants don't (Moe et al., 2008). AQP4, like AQP0 (1.A.8.8.2), forms water channels but also forms adhesive junctions (Engel et al., 2008) (causes cytotoxic brain swelling in mice (Yang et al., 2008)) Mice lacking Aqp4 have impaired olfactions (Lu et al., 2008). Aqp4 is down regulated in skeletal muscle in muscular dystrophy (Au et al. 2008). The crystal structure is known to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution (Tani et al., 2009). The structure reveals 8 water molecules in each of the four channels, supporting a hydrogen-bond isolation mechanism and explains its fast and selective water conduction and proton exclusion (Tani et al., 2009; Cui and Bastien, 2011). It is an important antigen in Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients (Kalluri et al., 2011). A connection has been made between AQP4-mediated fluid accumulation and post traumatic syringomyelia (Hemley et al. 2013). AQP4 has increased water permeability at low pH, and His95 is the pH-dependent gate (Kaptan et al. 2015). Also transports NH3 but not NH4+ (Assentoft et al. 2016). Cerebellar damage following status epilepticus involves down regulation of AQP4 expression (Tang et al. 2017). SUR1-TRPM4 and AQP4 form a complex to increase bulk water influx during astrocyte swelling (Stokum et al. 2017). A mutation, S111T, causes intellectual disability, hearing loss, and progressive gait dysfunction (Berland et al. 2018). As in humans, the chicken ortholog, Aqp4, is found in brain > kidney > stomach (Ram\u00edrez-Lorca et al. 2006). A Molecular Dynamics Investigation on Human AQP4 has been published (Marracino et al. 2018). AQP1 and AQP4 activities correlate with the severity of hydrocephalus induced by subarachnoid haemorrhage (Long et al. 2019). Di-lysine motif-like sequences formed by deleting the C-terminal domain of aquaporin-4 prevent its trafficking to the plasma membrane (Chau et al. 2021). Kidins220 deficiency causes ventriculomegaly via SNX27-retromer-dependent AQP4 degradation (Del Puerto et al. 2021). AQP4 expression is upregulated in cells exposed to dexamethasone, and SUMOylation [Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs)] may participate in this regulation (Zhang et al. 2020). Simultaneous calmodulin binding to the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of aquaporin 4 has been demonstrated (Ishida et al. 2021). Aqp-4 plays a role in secondary pathological processes (spinal cord edema, glial scar formation, and inflammatory response) after spinal cord injury, SCI. Loss of AQP-4 is associated with reduced spinal edema and improved prognosis after SCI in mice, and downregulation of AQP-4 reduces glial scar formation and the inflammatory response after SCI (Pan et al. 2022). AQP4 contributes to the migration and proliferation of gliomas, and to their resistance to therapy.

Water reabsorption is regulated by AQP2 trafficking between intracellular storage vesicles and the apical membrane. This process is tightly controlled by the pituitary hormone arginine vasopressin, and defective trafficking results in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The crystal structure of Aqp2 has been solved to 2.75\u00c5 (Frick et al. 2014). In terrestrial vertebrates, AQP2 function is generally regulated by arginine-vasopressin to accomplish key functions in osmoregulation such as the maintenance of body water homeostasis by a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism (Olesen and Fenton 2017; Martos-Sitcha et al. 2015). AQP2 is expressed in the anterior vaginal wall and fibroblasts, and regulates the expression level of collagen I\/III i, suggesting that AQP2 is associated with the pathogenesis of stress urinary incontinence through collagen metabolism during ECM remodeling (Zhang et al. 2017). As in humans, the chicken ortholog, Aqp2, is found only in the kidney (Ram\u00edrez-Lorca et al. 2006). AQP2 is critical in regulating urine concentrating ability. The expression and function of AQP2 are regulated by a series of transcriptional factors and post-transcriptional phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation (He and Yang 2019). Mutation or functional deficiency of AQP2 leads to severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and inhibition of various aquaporins leads to many water-related diseases such as, edema, cardiac arrest, and stroke.

A combination of symmetric and asymmetric motions opens the gate, and the asymmetric motion involves tilting of the TM2 helices (Szarecka et al. 2007). Acetylcholine receptor \u03b4 subunit mutations underlie a fast-channel myasthenic syndrome and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (Brownlow et al., 2001; Webster et al., 2012). Residues in TMS2 and the cytoplasmic loop linking TMSs 3 and 4 influence conductance, selectivity, gating and desensitization (Peters et al., 2010). nAChR and TRPC channel proteins (1.A.4) mediate nicotine addiction in many animals from humans to worms (Feng et al., 2006). Cholesterol recognition motifs in transmembrane domains of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor have been identified (Baier et al., 2011).\u00a0Allosteric modulators of the \u03b14\u03b22 subtype of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the dominant type in the brain, are numerous (Pandya and Yakel, 2011). \u03b12\u03b22 and\u00a0\u03b14\u03b22\u00a0nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are inhibited by the \u03b2-amyloid(1-42) peptide (Pandya and Yakel, 2011b). The A272E mutation in the alpha7 subunit gives rise to spinosad insensitivity without affecting activation by acetylcholine (Puinean et al. 2012). Inhibited by general anaesthetics (Nury et al., 2011). The X-ray crystal structures of the extracellular domain of the monomeric state of human neuronal alpha9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and of its complexes with the antagonists methyllycaconitine and alpha-bungarotoxin have been determined at resolutions of 1.8 A, 1.7 A and 2.7 A, respectively (Zouridakis et al. 2014). Structurally similar allosteric modulators of \u03b17 nAChR exhibit five different pharmacological effects (Gill-Thind et al. 2015). Mutations causing slow-channel myasthenia show that a valine ring in the channel is optimized for stabilizing gating (Shen et al. 2016). Quinoline derivatives act as agonists or antagonists depending on the type and subunit (Manetti et al. 2016). Conformational changes stabilize a twisted extracellular domain to promote transmembrane helix tilting, gate dilation, and the formation of a \"\"bubble\"\" that collapses to initiate ion conduction (Gupta et al. 2016). A high-affinity cholesterol-binding domain has been proposed for this and other ligand-gated ion channels (Di Scala et al. 2017). Positive allosteric modulators have been identified (Deba et al. 2018). Menthol stereoisomers exhibit fifferent effects on alpha4beta2 nAChR upregulation and dopamine neuron spontaneous firing (Henderson et al. 2019). Corticosteroids exert direct inhibitory action on the muscle-type AChR (Dworakowska et al. 2018). Both deltaL273F and epsilonL269F mutations impair channel gating by disrupting hydrophobic interactions with neighboring alpha-subunits. Differences in the extent of impairment of channel gating in delta and epsilon mutant receptors suggest unequal contributions of epsilon\/alpha and delta\/alpha subunit pairs to gating efficiency (Shen et al. 2019). Diffusion dynamics of the gangliosides, GM1s and AChRs is uniformly affected by the intracellular ATP level of a living muscle cell (He et al. 2020). M4, the outermost helix, is involved in opening of the alpha4beta2 nACh receptor (Mesoy and Lummis 2020). Cholesterol modulates the organization of the gammaM4 transmembrane domain of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (de Almeida et al. 2004). Cryo-EM images showed that cholesterol segregates preferentially around the constituent ion channel of the receptor, interacting with specific sites in both leaflets of the bilayer. Cholesterol forms microdomains - bridges of rigid sterol groups that link one channel to the next (Unwin 2021). Desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI) functionally affects human neurons similarly to the well-established neurotoxicant nicotine by triggering activation of alpha7 and several non-alpha7 nAChRs (Loser et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 4ZJS  PBDID: 5HBT"},{"0":"1.A.9.1.19","1":"Acetyl choline binding protein, AchBP, of 229 aas, corresponding to the N-terminal extracellular domain of AcChRs.

Mutations cause autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE;\u00a0D\u00edaz-Otero et al. 2000). Nicotinic receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction,  epilepsy and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. This system contributes to cognitive functioning through interactions with multiple neurotransmitter systems and is implicated in various CNS disorders, i.e., schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. It provides an extra layer of molecular complexity by existing in two  different stoichiometries determined by the subunit composition. By potentiating the action of an agonist through binding to an allosteric site, positive allosteric modulators can enhance cholinergic neurotransmission (Grupe et al. 2015). Most pentameric receptors are heteromeric.\u00a0Morales-Perez et al. 2016 presented the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. The side chains of alpha4 L257 (9') and alpha4L264 (16') may beresponsible for the main constrictions in the transmembrane pore (Yu et al. 2019). Mechanistic steps for communication proceed (1) through a signal generated via loop C in the principal subunit, (2) transmitted gradually and cumulatively to loop F of the complementary subunit, and (3) to the TMSs through the M2-M3 linker (Oliveira et al. 2019).

Acetylcholine binding induces conformational changes that result in open channel formation; opening is blocked by \u03b1-bungarotoxin. The protein is a homopentamer. It interacts with RIC3 for proper folding and assembly. The nAChR, but not the glycine receptor, GlyR, exhibits hydrophobic gating (Ivanov et al. 2007). Low resolution NMR structures with associated anesthetics have been reported (Bondarenko et al. 2013). Allosteric modulators exhibit up to 5 distinct pharmacological effects (Gill-Thind et al. 2015). Based on pore hydration and size, a high resolution structure for the channel in the open conformation has been proposed (Chiodo et al. 2015). Agonists reduce dyskinesias in both early- and later-stage Parkinson's disease (Zhang et al. 2015). Monoterpenes inhibit the alpha7 receptor in the order: carveol > thymoquinone > carvacrol > menthone > thymol > limonene > eugenole > pulegone = carvone = vanilin. Among the monoterpenes, carveol showed the highest potency (Lozon et al. 2016). A revised structural model has been proposed (Newcombe et al. 2017). In humans, exons 5-10 in CHRNA7 are duplicated and fused to the FAM7A genetic element, giving rise to the hybrid gene CHRFAM7A. Its product, dupalpha7, is a truncated subunit lacking part of the N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain and is associated with neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, and immunomodulation (Lasala et al. 2018). alpha7 and dupalpha7 subunits co-assemble into functional heteromeric receptors, in which at least two alpha7 subunits are required for channel opening. Dupalpha7's presence in the pentameric arrangement does not affect the duration of the potentiated events. Using an alpha7 subunit mutant, activation of (alpha7)2(dupalpha7)3 receptors occurs through ACh binding at the alpha7\/alpha7 interfacial binding site (Lasala et al. 2018). B-973 is an efficacious type II positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that, like 4BP-TQS and its active isomer GAT107, is able to produce direct allosteric activation in addition to potentiation of orthosteric agonist activity, which identifies it as an ago-PAM (Quadri et al. 2018). DB04763, DB08122 and pefloxacin are antagonists (they are NAMs) while furosemide potentiated ACh responses (it is a Pam) (Smelt et al. 2018). At nM concentration, APPs\u03b1 (amyloid precursor protein) is an allosteric activator of \u03b17-nAChR, mediated by the C-terminal 16 amino acids (CT\u03b116) (Korte 2019). At \u00b5M concentrations,\u00a0Rice et al. 2019 identified the GABABR1a as a target of APPs\u03b1, binding the sushi 1 domain via a 17\u2013amino acid sequence (17-mer).  These receptors activate opposing downstream cascades. The intrasubunit cavity of the\u00a0\u03b17 AcChR is important for the activity of type II positive allosteric modulators while the ECD-TMD junction and intersubunit sites are probably important for the activity of type I positive allosteric modulators (Targowska-Duda et al. 2019). Flavonoids are positive allosteric modulators of alpha7 nicotinic receptors (Nielsen et al. 2019). Active and desensitized state conformations have been examined (Chiodo et al. 2018). Modulators are able to activate or deactivate a7 receptors via allosteric binding; they are called positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) or negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) (Al Rawashdah et al. 2019). Functional divergence related sites cluster in the ligand binding domain, the beta2-beta3 linker close to the N-terminal alpha-helix, the intracellular linkers between transmembrane domains, and the \"transition zone\" (Pan et al. 2019). A series of phosphonate-functionalized 1,2,3-triazoles are positive allosteric modulators of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Nielsen et al. 2020). The E-1' --> A-1' substitution at the cytoplasmatic selectivity filter strongly affects sodium and chloride permeation in opposite directions, leading to a complete inversion of selectivity. Thus, structural determinants for the observed cationic-to-anionic inversion reveal a key role of the protonation state of residue rings far from the mutation, in the proximity of the hydrophobic channel gate (Cottone et al. 2020). Outer membrane mitochondrial nAChRs (e.g., \u03b17 NAChR) regulate apoptosis-induced mitochondrial channel formation by modulating the interplay of apoptosis-related proteins (VDAC1 and Bax) in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Kalashnyk et al. 2020). PNU-120596, a positive allosteric modulator of mammalian alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, increases the neuron response to alpha7 agonists while retarding desensitization (Vulfius et al. 2020). Differential interactions of resting, activated, and desensitized states of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with lipidic modulators have been decumented (Zhuang et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2MAW  PBDID: 5AFH  PBDID: 5AFJ  PBDID: 5AFK  PBDID: 5AFL  PBDID: 5AFM  PBDID: 5AFN"},{"0":"1.A.9.1.9","1":"The cation-selective pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, nAChR, with \u03b1 (461 aas; P02710), \u03b2 (493 aas; P02712), \u03b3 (506 aas; P02714) and \u03b4 (522 aas; P02718) subunits. The transmembrane domain of the uncoupled nAChR adopts a conformation distinct from that of the resting or desensitized state (Sun et al. 2016). Studies with this receptor have been reviewed (Unwin 2013). Many small molecules interact with nAChRs including d-tubocurarine, snake venom protein \u03b1-bungarotoxin (\u03b1-Bgt), and \u03b1-conotoxins, neurotoxic peptides from Conus snails. Various more recently discovered compounds of different structural classes also interact with nAChRs including the low-molecular weight alkaloids, pibocin, varacin and makaluvamines C and G. 6-Bromohypaphorine from the mollusk Hermissenda crassicornis does not bind to Torpedo nAChR but behaves as an agonist on human \u03b17 nAChR (Kudryavtsev et al. 2015). Dimethylaniline mimics the low potency and non-competitive actions of lidocaine on nAChRs, as opposed to the high potency and voltage-dependent block by lidocaine (Alberola-Die et al. 2016). Cholesterol is a potent modulator of the Torpedo nAChR (Baenziger et al. 2017). Cholesterol may play a mechanical role by conferring local rigidity to the membrane so that there is productive coupling between the extracellular and membrane domains, leading to opening of the channel (Unwin 2017). 11beta-(p-azidotetrafluorobenzoyloxy)allopregnanolone (F4N3Bzoxy-AP), a general anesthetic, a photoreactive allopregnanolone analog and a potent GABAAR PAM,was used to characterize steroid binding sites in the Torpedo nAChR in its native membrane environment (Yu et al. 2019). The steroid-binding site in the nAChR ion channel was identified, and additional steroid-binding sites could also be occupied by other lipophilic nAChR antagonists.

Ivermectin potentiates glycine-induced channel activation (Wang and Lynch, 2012). Molecular sites for the positive allosteric modulation of glycine receptors by endocannabinoids have been identified (Y\u00e9venes and Zeilhofer, 2011). Different subunits contribute asymmetrically to channel conductances via residues in the extracellular domain (Moroni et al., 2011; Xiong et al., 2012). Dominant and recessive mutations in GLRA1 are the major causes of hyperekplexia or startle disease (Gimenez et al., 2012). Open channel 3-d structures are known (Mowrey et al. 2013). Desensitization is regulated by interactions between the second and third transmembrane segments which affect the ion channel lumen near its intracellular end. The GABAAR and GlyR pore blocker, picrotoxin (TC# 8.C.1), prevents desensitization (Gielen et al. 2015). The x-ray structure of the \u03b11 GlyR transmembrane domain has been reported (Moraga-Cid et al. 2015), and residue S296 in hGlyR-alpha1 is involved in potentiation by Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Wells et al. 2015). The structure has also been elucidated by cryo EM (Du et al. 2015) and by x-ray crystalography (Huang et al. 2015). The latter presented a 3.0 A X-ray structure of the human glycine receptor-alpha3 homopentamer in complex with the high affinity, high-specificity antagonist, strychnine. The structure allowed exploration of the molecular recognition of antagonists. Comparisons with previous structures revealed a mechanism for antagonist-induced inactivation of Cys-loop receptors, involving an expansion of the orthosteric binding site in the extracellular domain that is coupled to closure of the ion pore in the transmembrane domain. The GlyR beta8-beta9 loop is an essential regulator of conformational rearrangements during ion channel opening and closing (Schaefer et al. 2017). Association of GlyR with the anchoring protein, gephyrin (Q9NQX3), is due to a hydrophobic interaction formed by Phe 330 of gephyrin and Phe 398 and Ile 400 of the GlyR beta-loop (Kim et al. 2006). Alcohols and volatile anesthetics enhance the function of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) by binding to a single anaesthetic binding site (Roberts et al. 2006). Aromatic residues in the GlyR M1, M3 and M4 \u03b1-helices are essential for receptor function (Tang and Lummis 2018). The neurological disorder, startle disease, is caused by glycinergic dysfunction, mainly due to missense mutations in genes encoding GlyR subunits (GLRA1 and GLRB). Another neurological disease with a phenotype similar to startle disease is a special form of stiff-person syndrome (SPS), which is most probably due to the development of GlyR autoantibodies (Schaefer et al. 2018). GlyRs can be modulated by positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that target the extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains (Lara et al. 2019). Mutations in GLRA1 give rise to hyperekplexia (Milenkovic et al. 2018). Neurosteroid binding sites of GABAARs are conserved in the GlyRs (Alvarez and Pecci 2019). The intracellular domain of homomeric glycine receptors modulates agonist efficacy (Ivica et al. 2020). Inhibitory glycinergic transmission in the adult spinal cord is primarily mediated by glycine receptors  (GlyRs) containing the alpha1 subunit. Alpha1ins, a longer alpha1 variant with 8 amino acids inserted into the intracellular large loop between TMSs 3 and 4, is expressed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, distributed at inhibitory synapses, and it is engaged in negative control over nociceptive signal transduction. Activation of metabotropic  glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5; TC# 9.A.14.7.1) specifically suppressed alpha1ins-mediated glycinergic transmission and evoked pain sensitization. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was critical for mGluR5 to inhibit alpha1ins. By binding to a D-docking site created by the 8-amino-acid insert ERK catalyzed alpha1ins phosphorylation at Ser380, which favored alpha1ins ubiquitination at Lys379 and led to alpha1ins endocytosis. Disruption of the ERK interaction with alpha1ins blocked Ser380 phosphorylation, potentiated glycinergic synaptic currents, and alleviated inflammatory and neuropathic pain (Zhang et al. 2019). The startle disease mutation (\u03b1S270T) affects the opening state for activation of presynaptic homomeric GlyRs, as well as postsynaptic heteromeric GlyRs, but the former are affected more. Both respond to glycine less efficiently (Wu et al. 2020). Cannabinoids exert therapeutic effects on several diseases such as chronic pain and startle disease by targeting glycine receptors (GlyRs). They target a serine residue at position 296 in the third TMS of the alpha1\/alpha3 GlyR on the outside of the channel at the lipid interface where cholesterol concentrates. GlyRs are associated with cholesterol\/caveolin-rich domains. and cholesterol reduction significantly inhibits cannabinoid potentiation of glycine-activated currents (Yao et al. 2020). Residues involved in glucose sensitivity of recombinant human glycine receptors have been identified (Hussein et al. 2020). Lipid-protein interactions are dependent on the receptor state, suggesting that lipids may regulate the receptor's conformational dynamics ((D\u00e4mgen and Biggin 2021)). Some protein-lipid interactions occur at a site at the communication interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domain, and in the active state, cholesterol can bind to the binding site of the positive allosteric modulator, ivermectin (D\u00e4mgen and Biggin 2021). An intracellular domain determines the agonist specificity (Ivica et al. 2021). The general anesthetic etomidate and fenamate mefenamic acid oppositely affect GABAAR and GlyR. These drugs potentiated GABAARs but blocked GlyRs (Rossokhin 2020). Alpha 1 glycine receptors are strongly inhibited by two flavanoids, quercetin and naringenin (Breitinger et al. 2021). The glycine receptor beta-subunit A455P variant occurs in a family affected by hyperekplexia syndrome (Aboheimed et al. 2022). Evidence for distinct roles of conserved proline residues in GlyR has been presented (Lummis and Dougherty 2022). Cannabinoids in general, and THC in particular, modulate pain perception via GlyR with possible clinical applications (Alvarez and Alves 2022).","2":"PBDID: 5CFB  PBDID: 5TIN  PBDID: 5TIO  PBDID: 5VDH  PBDID: 5VDI  PBDID: 1MOT  PBDID: 1VRY  PBDID: 2M6B  PBDID: 2M6I  PBDID: 4X5T"},{"0":"1.A.9.5.1","1":"\u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-inhibited chloride channel, GABARA1 or GABAAR.\u00a0The major central endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), directly acts at GABA(A) receptors.

GABA type A receptors, the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, are the targets for many general anesthetics, including volatile anesthetics, etomidate, propofol, and barbiturates. Anesthetics usually bind at intersubunit sites (Chiara et al. 2013). Etomidate and propofol are potent general anesthetics that act via GABAA receptor allosteric co-agonist sites located at transmembrane beta+\/alpha- inter-subunit interfaces. In heteromeric receptors, betaN265 (M2-15') on beta2 and beta3 subunits are important determinants of sensitivity to these drugs (Stewart et al. 2014). A P302L mutation in the gamma2 (\u03b32) subunit (Dravet syndrome in humans) of the mouse when expressed with the \u03b11 and \u03b23 subunits, produced a 90% decrease in conductance due to slow activation and enhance desensitization. It shifted the channel to a low-conductance state by reshaping the hour-glass-like pore cavity during transitions between closed, open, and desensitized states (Hernandez et al. 2017). Numerous postive and negative allosteric modulators have been identified (Maldifassi et al. 2016). Crystal structures of neurosteroids bound to alpha homopentameric GABAARs have revealed binding to five equivalent sites (Alvarez and Pecci 2018). Masiulis et al. 2019 reported high-resolution cryo-EM structures in which the full-length human alpha1beta3gamma2L GABAA receptor in lipid nanodiscs is bound to (1) the channel-blocker picrotoxin, (2) the competitive antagonist bicuculline, (3) the agonist GABA, and (4 AND 5) the classical benzodiazepines alprazolam and diazepam. They described the binding modes and mechanistic effects of these ligands, the closed and desensitized states of the GABAA receptor gating cycle, and the basis for allosteric coupling between the extracellular, agonist-binding region and the transmembrane, pore-forming region (Masiulis et al. 2019). Rare variants in the\u00a0\u03b5-subunit have been identified in patients with a wide spectrum of epileptic phenotypes (Markus et al. 2020). Many (but not all) sedative-hypnotics are capable of positively modulating the GABAA receptor by binding within a common set of hydrophobic cavities (McGrath et al. 2020). Isoflurane binds to a site within the transmembrane domains of the receptor and suggest functional similarity between the GABA(A) alpha-1, -2, and -3 subunits (Schofield and Harrison 2005). Mutations ain the M2 and M3 TMSs of the GABAARs alpha1 and beta2 subunits affect late gating transitions including opening\/closing and desensitization (Terejko et al. 2021). The distance between an alpha1beta3gamma2L GABA type A receptor residue and the drug, etomidate, when bound in the transmembrane beta+\/alpha- interface, has been determined (Fantasia et al. 2021). There is a binding site in the beta(+)alpha(-) interface for the anesthetic, propofol (Borghese et al. 2021). Delta selective compound 2 (DS2; 4-chloro-N-[2-(2-thienyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl]benzamide) is widely  used to study selective actions mediated by delta-subunit-containing GABAA receptors. The molecular determinants responsible for positive modulation by DS2 have been identified (Falk-Petersen et al. 2021). Two high-resolution structures of GABAA receptors in complex with zolpidem, a positive allosteric modulator and heavily prescribed hypnotic, and DMCM, a negative allosteric modulator with convulsant and anxiogenic properties. These two drugs share the extracellular benzodiazepine site at the alpha\/gamma subunit interface and two transmembrane sites at beta\/alpha interfaces. Structural analyses reveal a basis for the subtype selectivity of zolpidem that underlies its clinical success (Zhu et al. 2022). Molecular dynamics simulations provided insight into how DMCM switches from a negative to a positive modulator as a function of binding site occupancy (Zhu et al. 2022). Avermectin-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine hybrids are potent GABAA receptor modulators (Volkova et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 6DW0  PBDID: 6DW1"},{"0":"1.A.9.5.2","1":"\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-inhibited Cl- channel, type A (\u03b1-, \u03b2- \u03b3-subunit precursors), GABRA2 or GABAAR2, regulated by GABA receptor accessory protein, GABARAP (Luu et al., 2006) and FRMD7 (TC# 8.A.25.1.5) (Jiang et al. 2020). A mutation in the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit, linked to human epilepsy, affects channel gating properties (Fisher 2004). The anti-convulsant stiripentol acts directly on the GABA(A) receptor as a positive allosteric modulator (Fisher 2009). The major central endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), also directly acts at GABA(A) receptors to potentiate the receptor at low GABA concentrations (Sigel et al., 2011). The recpetor is also allosterically regulated by neurosteroids via TMS1 of the beta subunit (Baker et al. 2010). General anesthetic binding site(s) have been identified (Chiara et al., 2012; Woll et al. 2018).\u00a0Hydrophobic anions potently and uncompetitively antagonize GABA (A) receptor function (Chisari et al., 2011).\u00a0Regulated by neurosteroids; activated by pregnenolone and allopregnenalone (Costa et al., 2012). Allopregnanolone and its synthetic analog alphaxalone are GABAAR positive allosteric modulators (Yu et al. 2019). Different subunits contribute asymmetrically to channel conductances via residues in the extracellular domain (Moroni et al., 2011). Potentiated by general anaesthetics (Nury et al., 2011). Both the alpha and beta subunits are important for activation by alcohols and anaesthetics (McCracken et al. 2010).\u00a0Direct physical coupling between the GABA-A receptor (of 4 TMSs) and the KCC2 chloride transporter underlies ionic plasticity in cerebellar purkinje neurons in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Huang et al. 2013). An anesthetic binding site has been identified (Franks 2015). Desensitization is regulated by interactions between the second and third transmembrane segments which affect the ion channel lumen near its intracellular end. The GABAAR and GlyR pore blocker, picrotoxin (TC# 8.C.1), prevents desensitization (Gielen et al. 2015). The mechanism of action of methaqualone (2-methyl-3-O-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, Quaalude(R)), a sedative-hypnotic and recreational drug. Methaqualone is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at human alpha1,2,3,5beta2,3gamma2S GABAA receptors (GABAARs) expressed, whereas it displays diverse functionalities at the alpha4,6beta1,2,3delta GABAAR subtypes, ranging from inactivity (alpha4beta1delta), through negative (alpha6beta1delta) or positive allosteric modulation (alpha4beta2delta, alpha6beta2,3delta), to superagonism (alpha4beta3delta) (Hammer et al. 2015). The thyroid hormone L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) inhibits GABAA receptors at micromolar concentrations and has common features with neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone (ALLOP).\u00a0Westergard et al. 2015 used functional experiments on alpha2beta1gamma2 GABAA receptors to detect competitive interactions between T3 and an agonist (ivermectin, IVM) with a crystallographically determined binding site at subunit interfaces in the transmembrane domain of a homologous receptor (glutamate-gated chloride channel, GluCl). T3 and ALLOP showed competitive effects, supporting the presence of a T3 and ALLOP binding site at one or more subunit interfaces. Residues in the beta3 subunit, at or near the etomidate\/propofol binding site(s), form part of the valerenic acid modulator binding pocket (Luger et al. 2015). IV general anesthetics, including propofol, etomidate, alphaxalone, and barbiturates, enhance GABAA receptor activation. These anesthetics bind in transmembrane pockets between subunits of typical synaptic GABAA receptors (Forman and Miller 2016). Carisoprodol can directly gate and allosterically modulate type A GABA (GABAA) receptors (Kumar et al. 2017). The former sedative-hypnotic and recreational drug methaqualone (Quaalude) is a moderately potent, non-selective positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) (Hammer et al. 2015). A methaqualone analog, 2-phenyl-3-(p-tolyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (PPTQ) exhibits intrinsic activity at micromolar concentrations and potentiates the GABA-evoked signaling at concentrations down to the low-nanomolar range (Madjroh et al. 2018). The PPTQ binding site is allosterically linked with sites targeted by neurosteroids and barbiturates. Anesthetic pharmacophore binding has been studied (Fahrenbach and Bertaccini 2018). GABAA receptors are modulated via several sites by GABA, benzodiazepines, ethanol, neurosteroids and anaesthetics among others. Amundarain et al. 2018 presented a model of the alpha1beta2gamma2 subtype GABAA receptor in the APO state and in complex with selected ligands, including agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators. Sites in TMSs 2 and 3 are important for alcohol-induced conformational changes (Jung and Harris 2006). Many anesthetics and neurosteroids act through binding to the GABAAR transmembrane domainnad x-ray structures have revealed how\u00a0\u03b1-xalone, a neurosteroid anaesthetic, binds and influences potentiation, activation and desensitization (Chen et al. 2018). AA29504 is an allosteric agonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (Olander et al. 2018). Allosteric shift analysis in mutant \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32L GABAA receptors indicates selectivity and cross-talk among intersubunit transmembrane anesthetic sites (Szabo et al. 2019). Several epilepsy-causing mutations have been identified in the genes of the \u03b11, \u03b23, and \u03b32 subunits comprising the GABAA receptor (Absalom et al. 2019). Constituents of the GABAA receptor include a transmembrane GARLH\/LHFPL protein (TC# 1.A.82.1.7) and the inhibitory synaptic protein, neuroligin 2 (TC# 8.A.117.1.1) (Tomita 2019). GABAA receptors containing mutant alpha5 and alpha1 subunits all had reduced cell surface and total cell expression with altered endoplasmic reticulum processing, impaired synaptic clustering, reduced GABAA receptor function and decreased GABA binding potency. Thus, GABRA5 is a causative gene for early onset epileptic encephalopathy (Hernandez et al. 2019). Mutations at Gln242 or Trp246 that eliminate neurosteroid effects do not eliminate neurosteroid binding within the intersubunit site, but significantly alter the preferred orientation of the neurosteroid (Sugasawa et al. 2019). Binding sites and interactions of propanidid and AZD3043 within GABAAR have been identified (Wang et al. 2018). Clptm1 limits GABAAR forward trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane, and it regulates inhibitory homeostatic plasticity (Ge et al. 2018). The mechanisms of potentiation and inhibition of GABAA receptors by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, niflumic and mefenamic acids, have been described (Rossokhin et al. 2019). GABAARs are targets for important classes of clinical agents (e.g., anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, and general anesthetics) that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). PAMs bind selectively to a single intersubunit site in the GABAAR transmembrane domain (Jayakar et al. 2019). The gamma2 subunit is required for clustering of these receptors, for recruitment of the submembrane scaffold protein gephyrin to postsynaptic sites, and for postsynaptic function of GABAergic inhibitory synapses (Alldred et al. 2005). The fourth TMS of the gamma2 subunit is required for postsynaptic clustering, but both the major cytoplasmic loop and the fourth transmembrane domain contribute to efficient recruitment of gephyrin to postsynaptic receptor clusters and are essential for restoration of miniature IPSCs (Alldred et al. 2005). Oligomerization and cell surface expression of recombinant GABAA receptors tagged in the delta subunit have been examined (Oflaz et al. 2019). The isoxazoline ectoparasiticide, fluralaner, exerts antiparasitic effects by inhibiting the function of GABARs, but substitutions of Gly333 in TMS3 led to substantial reductions in the sensitivity to fluralaner (Yamato et al. 2020). A potent photoreactive general anesthetic with novel binding site selectivity for GABAA receptors has been identified (Shalabi et al. 2020). GABAA receptor neurosteroid binding sites have been reviewed (Alvarez et al. 2019). Missense variants in GABRA2 are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) as well as other disorders (Sanchis-Juan et al. 2020). Elevin novel molecules, identified using reinforcement learning, showed positive allosteric modulation, with two showing 50% activation in the low micromolar range (Michaeli et al. 2020). GABAA Receptor ligands interact with binding sites in the transmembrane domain and in the extracellular domain (Iorio et al. 2020). Many (but not all) sedative-hypnotics are capable of positively modulating the GABAA receptor by binding within a common set of hydrophobic cavities (McGrath et al. 2020). Allopregnanolone (3alpha5alpha-P), pregnanolone), and their synthetic derivatives are potent positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABAA receptors with in vivo anesthetic, anxiolytic, and anti-convulsant effects. Photoaffinity labeling procedures have been used to identify an intersubunit steroid-binding site in heteromeric GABA type A (GABAA) receptors (Jayakar et al. 2020). Diazepam binds to etomidate binding sites in the transmembrane receptor domain giving rise to antagonism (McGrath et al. 2020). The alpha1 subunit histidine 55 at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains affects preactivation and desensitization of the GABAA receptor (Kaczor et al. 2021). Coordinated downregulation of KCC2 and the GABAA receptor contributes to inhibitory dysfunction during seizure induction (Wan et al. 2020). Loss of GABAergic inhibition provides a mechanism underlying GABRB2-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (El Achkar et al. 2021). GABAAR binds the anaesthetic, Propofol, to induced conformational changes (Yuan et al. 2021). Methaqualone (2-methyl-3-(o-tolyl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-one, MTQ) is a moderately potent positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABAA receptors (GABAARs). Several additional potent GABAAR PAMs include 2,3-diphenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (PPQ), 3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (Cl-PPQ), and others (Wang et al. 2020). Interfacial binding sites for cholesterol on GABAA receptors compete with neurosteroids (Lee 2021). GABAAR is inhibited by L-type calcium channel blockers (Das et al. 2004). In in vivo studies, Stigmasterol (0.5-3.0 mg\/kg, i.p.) exerted significant anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects in an identical manner to allopregnanolone, indicating the involvement of a GABAergic mechanism. Thus, GABAA receptors are subject to anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities of stigmasterol. Thus, stigmasterol is a candidate steroidal drug for the treatment of neurological disorders due to its positive modulation of GABA receptors (Karim et al. 2021). Sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids harbor modulatory allosteric properties that affect inhibitoryGABAA receptors (Janzen et al. 2021). High-dose benzodiazepines positively modulate GABAA receptors via a flumazenil-insensitive mechanism (Wang et al. 2021). Benzodiazepine binding to transmembrane anaesthetic binding sites of the GABAA receptor can produce positive or negative modulation manifesting as decreases or increases in locomotion, respectively. Selectivity for these sites may contribute to the distinct GABAA receptor and behavioural actions of different benzodiazepines, particularly at high anaesthetic concentrations (McGrath et al. 2021). (+)-Catharanthine potentiates the GABAA receptor by binding to a transmembrane site at the beta(+)\/alpha(-) interface near the TMS2-TMS3 loop (Arias et al. 2022). Diazepam derivatives are allosteric modulators of GABAA receptor alpha1beta2gamma2 subtypes (Djebaili et al. 2022). \u03b11 proline 277 residues regulate GABAAR gating through M2-M3 loop interactions in the interfacial region (Kaczor et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1GNU  PBDID: 1KLV  PBDID: 1KM7  PBDID: 1KOT  PBDID: 3D32  PBDID: 3DOW  PBDID: 3WIM  PBDID: 4XC2  PBDID: 5DPS  PBDID: 6HB9  PBDID: 6HOG  PBDID: 6HOH  PBDID: 6HOJ  PBDID: 6HOK  PBDID: 6HYL  PBDID: 6HYM  PBDID: 6HYN  PBDID: 6HYO  PBDID: 7BRQ  PBDID: 7BRT  PBDID: 7BRU  PBDID: 7BV4  PBDID: 6D6T  PBDID: 6D6U  PBDID: 6X3S  PBDID: 6X3T  PBDID: 6X3U  PBDID: 6X3V  PBDID: 6X3W  PBDID: 6X3X  PBDID: 6X3Z  PBDID: 6X40"},{"0":"1.A.9.5.4","1":"The GABA receptor consisting of \u03b11, \u03b23, and \u03b32 subunits.

Functions as a receptor for diazepines and various anesthetics, such as pentobarbital which bind to separate allosteric effector binding  sites. Functions as ligand-gated chloride channel (Jayakar et al. 2015). GABRA1 mutations are associated with familial juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, sporadic childhood absence epilepsy, idiopathic familial generalized epilepsy, infantile spasms and Dravet syndrome. Thus, GABRA1 mutations are associated with infantile epilepsy including early onset epileptic encephalopathies including Ohtahara syndrome and West syndrome (Kodera et al. 2016). A variant of GABRA1 (A332V) causes increased sensitivity for GABA and alterred desensitization (Steudle et al. 2020).

The basis for ion selectivity has been reported (Fritsch et al., 2011). Two stage tilting of the pore lining helices results in channel opening and closing (Zhu and Hummer, 2010). The mechanical work of opening the pore is performed primarily on the M2-M3 loop. Strong interactions of this short and conserved loop with the extracellular domain are therefore crucial to couple ligand binding to channel opening. The H+-activated GLIC has an extracellular domain between TMSs M3 and M4 but lacks the intracellular domain (ICD) which is a distinct folding domain (Goyal et al., 2011). The structural basis for alcohol modulation of GLIC has been reported (Howard et al., 2011). The structure of the M2 TMS indicates that the charge selectivity filter is in the cytoplasmic half of the channel (Parikh et al. 2011). Below pH 5.0, GLIC desensitizes on a time scale of minutes. During activation, the extracellular hydrophobic region undergoes changes involving outward translational movement, away from the pore axis, leading to an increase in pore diameter. The lower end of M2 remains relatively immobile (Velisetty et al., 2012). During desensitization, the intervening polar residues in the middle of M2 move closer to form a solvent-occluded barrier and thereby reveal the location of a distinct desensitization gate. In comparison to the crystal structure of GLIC, the structural dynamics of the channel in a membrane environment suggest a more loosely packed conformation with water-accessible intrasubunit vestibules penetrating from the extracellular end all the way to the middle of M2 in the closed-state (Velisetty et al. 2012). Pore opening and closing is well understood (Zhu and Hummer 2010). X-ray structures of general anaesthetics bound to GLIC revealed a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer (Nury et al., 2011). Large blockers bind in the center of the membrane, but divalent transition metal ions bind to the narrow intracellular pore entry (Hilf et al., 2010). Alcohols and anaesthetics induce structural changes and activate ligand-gated ion channels of the LIC family by binding in intersubunit cavities (Sauguet et al. 2013; Ghosh et al. 2013). Gating at pH 4 has been visualized by x-ray crystallography (Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al. 2013) Site-directed spin labeling and x-ray analyses have revealed gating transition motions and mechanisms that distinguish active from desensitized states (Dellisanti et al. 2013; Sauguet et al. 2013). Gating involves major rearrangements of the interfacial loops (Velisetty et al. 2014). A single point mutation can change the effect of an anesthetic (desfurane; chloroform) from an inhibitor to a potentiator (Br\u00f6mstrup et al. 2013). An interhelix hydrogen bond involving His234 is important for stabilization of the open state (Rienzo et al. 2014). The outermost M4 TMS makes distinct contributions to the maturation and gating of the related GLIC and ELIC homologs, suggesting that they exhibit divergent mechanisms of channel function (H\u00e9nault et al. 2015). The same allosteric network may underlie the actions of various anesthetics, regardless of binding site (Joseph and Mincer 2016). GLIC and ELIC (TC# 1.A.9.9.1) may represent distinct transmembrane domain archetypes (Therien and Baenziger 2017). Arcario et al. 2017 have demonstrated an anesthetic binding site in GLIC which is accessed through a membrane-embedded tunnel. The anesthetic interacts with a previously known site, resulting in conformational changes that produce a non-conductive state of the channel (Arcario et al. 2017). The gating mechanism has been studied (Lev et al. 2017). R-Ketamine inhibits members of the LIC family, and the structural and dynamics basis for the assymetric inhibitory modulation of ketamine has been revealed (Ion et al. 2017). Residue E35 has been identified as a key proton-sensing residue, as neutralization of its side chain carboxylate stabilizes the active state. Thus, proton activation occurs allosterically at the level of multiple loci with a key contribution of the coupling interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (Nemecz et al. 2017). General anesthetics can allosterically favor closed channels by binding in the pore or favor open channels via various subsites in the transmembrane domain (Fourati et al. 2018). GLIC's gating by protonation proceeds by making use of loop F, already known as an allosteric site in other pLGICs, instead of the classic orthosteric site (Hu et al. 2018). Binding of fentanyl to its binding site within GLIC results in conformational changes that inhibit conduction through the channel (Faulkner et al. 2019). This channel and others have been studied by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) which has made it possible to characterized the conformational dynamics of single unlabeled transmembrane channels and transporters (Heath and Scheuring 2019). Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels undergo subtle conformational cycling to control electrochemical signal transduction. Lycksell et al. 2021 used small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to probe ambient solution-phase properties of GLIC under resting and activating conditions. Resting-state GLIC was the best-fit crystal structure to SANS curves, with no evidence for divergent mechanisms. Thus, the findings demonstrate state-dependent changes in a pentameric ion channel by SANS. A 3-state model has been proposed; mutations at the subunit interface in the extracellular domain (ECD) principally alter pre-activation, while mutations in the lower ECD and the transmembrane domain principally alter activation. Propofol alters both transitions (Lefebvre et al. 2021). Cryo-EM structures of GLIC under three pH conditions showed that decreased pH is associated with improved resolution and side chain rearrangements at the subunit\/domain interface, particularly involving functionally important residues in the beta1-beta2 and M2-M3 loops. Molecular dynamics simulations substantiated flexibility in the closed-channel extracellular domains relative to the transmembrane ones and supported electrostatic remodeling around E35 and E243 in proton-induced gating. Exploration of secondary cryo-EM classes further indicated a low-pH population with an expanded pore (Rov\u0161nik et al. 2021). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) by selectively binding to a single site in the outer transmembrane domain of ELIC (Dietzen et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 3EAM  PBDID: 3EHZ  PBDID: 3EI0  PBDID: 3IGQ  PBDID: 2XQ3  PBDID: 2XQ4  PBDID: 2XQ5  PBDID: 2XQ6  PBDID: 2XQ7  PBDID: 2XQ8  PBDID: 2XQ9  PBDID: 2XQA  PBDID: 3LSV  PBDID: 3P4W  PBDID: 3P50  PBDID: 3TLS  PBDID: 3TLT  PBDID: 3TLU  PBDID: 3TLV  PBDID: 3TLW  PBDID: 3UU3  PBDID: 3UU4  PBDID: 3UU5  PBDID: 3UU6  PBDID: 3UU8  PBDID: 3UUB  PBDID: 4F8H  PBDID: 4HFB  PBDID: 4HFC  PBDID: 4HFD  PBDID: 4HFE  PBDID: 4HFH  PBDID: 4HFI  PBDID: 4IL4  PBDID: 4IL9  PBDID: 4ILA  PBDID: 4ILB  PBDID: 4ILC  PBDID: 4IRE  PBDID: 4LMJ  PBDID: 4LMK  PBDID: 4LML  PBDID: 4NPP  PBDID: 4NPQ  PBDID: 4QH1  PBDID: 4QH4  PBDID: 4QH5  PBDID: 4X5T  PBDID: 4YEU  PBDID: 4zzb  PBDID: 5hcm  PBDID: 5heg  PBDID: 5heh  PBDID: 4ZZC  PBDID: 5HCJ  PBDID: 5IUX  PBDID: 5J0Z  PBDID: 5L47  PBDID: 5L4E  PBDID: 5L4H  PBDID: 5MUO  PBDID: 5MUR  PBDID: 5MVM  PBDID: 5MVN  PBDID: 5MZQ  PBDID: 5MZR  PBDID: 5MZT  PBDID: 5NJY  PBDID: 5NKJ  PBDID: 5OSA  PBDID: 5OSB  PBDID: 5OSC  PBDID: 5V6N  PBDID: 5V6O  PBDID: 6EMX  PBDID: 6F0I  PBDID: 6F0J  PBDID: 6F0M  PBDID: 6F0N  PBDID: 6F0R  PBDID: 6F0U  PBDID: 6F0V  PBDID: 6F0Z  PBDID: 6F10  PBDID: 6F11  PBDID: 6F12  PBDID: 6F13  PBDID: 6F15  PBDID: 6F16  PBDID: 6F7A  PBDID: 6HJ3  PBDID: 6HJA  PBDID: 6HJB  PBDID: 6HJI  PBDID: 6HJZ  PBDID: 6HPP  PBDID: 6HY5  PBDID: 6HY9  PBDID: 6HYA  PBDID: 6HYR  PBDID: 6HYV  PBDID: 6HYW  PBDID: 6HYX  PBDID: 6HYZ  PBDID: 6HZ0  PBDID: 6HZ1  PBDID: 6HZ3  PBDID: 6HZW  PBDID: 6I08"},{"0":"1.A.9.9.1","1":"The bacterial pentameric Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand-gated ion channel), ELIC.

X-ray structures and functional measurements support a pore-blocking mechanism for the inhibitory action of short-chain alcohols which bind to the TMSs (Chen et al. 2016). GLIC (TC# 1.A.9.8.1) and ELIC may represent distinct transmembrane domain archetypes (Therien and Baenziger 2017), and both bind hopenoids at the mamalian cholesterol binding site (Barrantes and Fantini 2016). A high-resolution structure of ELIC in a lipid-bound state has revealed a phospholipid binding site at the lower half of pore-forming transmembrane helices M1 and M4 and at a nearby site for neurosteroids, cholesterol or general anesthetics (H\u00e9nault et al. 2019). This site is shaped by an M4-helix kink and a Trp-Arg-Pro triad that is highly conserved in eukaryote GABAA\/C and glycine receptors. M4 is intrinsically flexible, and M4 deletions or disruptions of the lipid-binding site accelerate desensitization, suggesting that lipid interactions shape the agonist response (H\u00e9nault et al. 2019). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) stabilizes the open state of ELIC relative to the desensitized state by direct binding to specific sites (Tong et al. 2019). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the Torpedo electric organ, when reconstituted in membranes formed by zwitterionic phospholipids alone, exposure to agonist fails to elicit ion-flux activity, and ELIC has a similar lipid sensitivity. Structures of ELIC in palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine- (POPC-) only nanodiscs in both the unliganded (4.1-\u00c5 resolution) and agonist-bound (3.3 \u00c5) states using single-particle cryoEM have been solved (Kumar et al. 2020). The largest differences occur at the level of loop C - at the agonist-binding sites - and the loops at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (ECD and TMD, respectively). The transmembrane pore is occluded similarly in both structures. POPC-only membranes prevent ECD-TMD coupling so that the \"conformational wave\" of liganded-receptor gating takes place in the ECD and the interfacial M2-M3 linker, but fails to penetrate the membrane and propagate into the TMD. The higher affinity for agonists, characteristic of the open- and desensitized-channel conformations, results from the tighter confinement of the ligand to its binding site; this limits the ligand's fluctuations, and thus delays its escape into bulk solvent (Kumar et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 2VL0  PBDID: 2YKS  PBDID: 2YOE  PBDID: 3ZKR  PBDID: 4A97  PBDID: 4A98  PBDID: 4TWD  PBDID: 4TWF  PBDID: 4TWH  PBDID: 4YEU  PBDID: 3rqu  PBDID: 3uq4  PBDID: 3uq5  PBDID: 3uq7  PBDID: 5hej  PBDID: 5heo  PBDID: 5heu  PBDID: 5hew  PBDID: 5LID  PBDID: 5SXV  PBDID: 6HJX  PBDID: 6HJY  PBDID: 6HK0  PBDID: 6SSI  PBDID: 6SSP"},{"0":"1.A.94.1.1","1":"Non-structural glycoprotein 4, NSP4 or enterotoxin, of 175 aas and 2 TMSs (Hyser et al. 2012).

OmpF can deliver peptides of >6 KDa (epitopes) including protamine, through the pore lumen from the periplasm to the outside (Housden et al., 2010; Ghale et al. 2014). For cephalosporin antibiotics, the interaction strength series is ceftriaxone > cefpirome > ceftazidime (Lovelle et al. 2011). An unfolded protein such as colicin E9 can thread through OmpF from the outside to reach the periplasm (Housden et al. 2013). Polynucleotides can pass through OmpF (Hadi-Alijanvand and Rouhani 2015). LPS influences the movement of bulk ions (K+ and Cl-), but the ion selectivity of OmpF is mainly affected by bulk ion concentrations (Patel et al. 2016). OMPs such as OmpF cluster into islands that restrict their lateral mobility, while IMPs generally diffuse throughout the cell.\u00a0Rassam et al. 2018 demonstrated that when transient, energy-dependent transmembrane connections are formed, IMPs become subjugated by the inherent organisation of OMPs, and that such connections impact IMP function. They showed that while establishing a translocon for import, colicin ColE9 sequesters the IMPs of the proton motive force (PMF)-linked Tol-Pal complex into islands mirroring those of colicin-bound OMPs. Through this imposed organisation, the bacteriocin subverts the outer-membrane stabilizing role of Tol-Pal, blocking its recruitment to cell division sites and slowing membrane constriction. The ordering of IMPs by OMPs via an energised inter-membrane bridge represents an emerging functional paradigm in cell envelope biology (Rassam et al. 2018). Colicin E9 (ColE9) disordered regions exploit OmpF for direction-specific binding, which ensures the constrained presentation of an activating signal within the bacterial periplasm (Housden et al. 2018). Anionic lipid binding can prevent closure of OmpF channels, thereby increasing access of antibiotics that use porin-mediated pathways (Liko et al. 2018). OmpF may be the major route of D-lactate\/D-3-hydroxybutyrate oligo-ester secretion (Utsunomia et al. 2017). Lipid Headgroup Charge and Acyl Chain Composition Modulate Closure of the channel (Perini et al. 2019). Piperacillin, tazobactam, ampicillin and sulbactam interact strongly with OmpF, and may be transported (Wang et al. 2019). Gating kinetics are governed by lipid characteristics so that each stage of a sequential closure is different from the previous one, probably because of intra- or intermonomeric rearrangements (Perini et al. 2019). OmpF transports fosfomycin (Golla et al. 2019) and bacteriocins into cells. Polypeptide transport\/binding processes generate an essentially irreversible, hook-like assembly that constrains an import activating peptide epitope between two subunits of the OmpF trimer (Lee et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 1BT9  PBDID: 1GFM  PBDID: 1GFN  PBDID: 1GFO  PBDID: 1GFP  PBDID: 1GFQ  PBDID: 1HXT  PBDID: 1HXU  PBDID: 1HXX  PBDID: 1MPF  PBDID: 1OPF  PBDID: 2OMF  PBDID: 2ZFG  PBDID: 2ZLD  PBDID: 3FYX  PBDID: 3HW9  PBDID: 3HWB  PBDID: 3K19  PBDID: 3K1B  PBDID: 3POQ  PBDID: 3POU  PBDID: 3POX  PBDID: 4GCP  PBDID: 4GCQ  PBDID: 4GCS  PBDID: 4JFB  PBDID: 4LSE  PBDID: 4LSF  PBDID: 4LSH  PBDID: 4LSI  PBDID: 3O0E  PBDID: 4D5U  PBDID: 5NUO  PBDID: 5NUQ  PBDID: 5NUR"},{"0":"1.B.1.1.15","1":"OmpU porin (cation-selective; PK\/PCl = 14; bile salt inducible) (low permeability to bile) (Simonet et al., 2003).

The  strength of this network governs the probability of cations binding behind L3.

Functionally important conserved motifs have been identified (Delattre et al., 2010). The x-ray structure reveals a beta-barrel pore obstructed by two structural elements conserved in all two partner secretion systems, an N-terminal \u03b1-helix and an extracellular loop. FhaC goes from the closed to the open state in the presence of the filamentous haemagglutinin adhesin, FHA. The N-terminal \u03b1-helix is displaced into the periplasm during FHA secretion (Gu\u00e9rin et al. 2014). With two POTRA domains in the periplasm, a transmembrane beta barrel and a large loop harboring a functionally important motif, FhaC epitomizes the conserved features of the superfamily (Jacob-Dubuisson et al. 2009). The conserved secretion domain of FHA interacts with the POTRA domains, specific extracellular loops and strands of FhaC and the inner beta-barrel surface. The interaction map indicates a funnel-like pathway, with conformationally flexible FHA entering the channel in a non-exclusive manner and exiting along a four-stranded beta-sheet at the surface of the FhaC barrel. This sheet of FhaC guides the secretion domain of FHA along discrete steps of translocation and folding (Baud et al. 2014). The membrane-proximal POTRA domain exists in several conformations, and the binding of FHA displaces this equilibrium (Gu\u00e9rin et al. 2015). TpsB (Two Partner Secretion) transporters belong to the Omp85 or OMPPI superfamily, whose members catalyze protein insertion into, or translocation across membranes. They are composed of a transmembrane \u03b2 barrel preceded by two periplasmic POTRA domains that bind the incoming protein substrate. Sicoli et al. 2022 detected minor states in heterogeneous populations, identifying transient conformers of FhaC. This revealed substantial, spontaneous conformational changes on a slow time scale, with parts of the POTRA2 domain approaching the lipid bilayer and the protein's surface loops. An amphipathic POTRA2 \u03b2 hairpin  inserts into the \u03b2 barrel, and these motions enlarge the channel to initiate substrate secretion. This shows how TpsB transporters mediate protein secretion without the need for cofactors, by utilizing intrinsic protein dynamics (Sicoli et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2QDZ  PBDID: 3NJT  PBDID: 4QKY  PBDID: 4QL0"},{"0":"1.B.21.1.1","1":"Non-specific, 14\u00a0\u03b2-stranded monomeric OmpG porin (Conlan et al. 2000). pH-induced conformational changes of OmpG have been studied after reconstitution in native E. coli\u00a0lipids (Mari et al., 2010). Encoded by a gene in a gene cluster also encoding an ABC sugar uptake system (TC# 3.A.1.1.46), a glucosyl hydrolase and two oxidoreductases. Therefore it's phsiological function may be glucoside uptake. At neutral\/high pH, the channel is open and permeable to substrates of size up to 900Da. At acidic pH,  loop L6 folds across the channel and blocks the pore. The channel blockage at acidic pH appears to be triggered by the protonation of a histidine pair on neighboring \u03b2-strands, which repel one another, resulting in the rearrangement of loop L6 and channel closure (K\u00f6ster et al. 2015). Crystallization and analysis by electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed the fundamental mechanisms essential for channel activity. A 28 aa extension has been added to the 14 \u03b2-TMS barrel to make a 16 \u03b2-TMS barrel with normal activity and stability but differing pH sensitivity (Korkmaz et al. 2015). A minimized OmpG porin of only 220 aas still exhibits gating, but it was 5-fold less frequent than in native OmpG. The residual gating of the minimal pore is independent of L6 rearrangements and involves narrowing of the  ion conductance pathway, most probably driven by global stretching-flexing deformations of the membrane-embedded \u03b2-barrel (Grosse et al. 2014). pH-dependent gating is controlled by an electrostatic interaction network formed between the gating loop and charged residues in the lumen (Perez-Rathke et al. 2018). 3-d structures of the protein in lipid bilayers have been solved (Retel et al. 2017). OmpG may provide a route for D-lactate\/D-3-hydroxybutyrate oligo-ester secretion as well as sugar uptake (Utsunomia et al. 2017). OmpG lacks a central constriction and has an exceptionally wide pore diameter of about 13\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c5.

High-resolution structures of crystal forms of BamA POTRA4-5 from E. coli\u00a0has been reported (Zhang et al., 2011; Sinnige et al. 2014).\u00a0Solid-state NMR on BamA, a large multidomain integral membrane protein, revealed dynamic conformational states (Renault et al., 2011). In contrast to the N-terminal periplasmic polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domains, the C-terminal transmembrane \u03b2-barrel domain of BamA is mechanically much more stable. Exposed to mechanical stress, this \u03b2-barrel stepwise unfolds \u03b2-hairpins until unfolding has been completed. The mechanical stabilities of \u03b2-barrel and \u03b2-hairpins are thereby modulated by the POTRA domains, the membrane composition and the extracellular lid closing the \u03b2-barrel. The NMR structure of SmpA (OmlA) is also known (Vanini et al. 2006). The periplasmic region of BamA is firmly attached to the \u03b2-barrel and does not experience fast global motion around the angle between POTRA 2 and 3, but the barrel is flexible (Sinnige et al. 2014). It appears that the BAM complex does not catalyze insertion and assembly of all out membrane (\u03b1- and \u03b2-)porins (Dunstan et al. 2015). YfgL shows significant sequence similarity (e-9) with YxaL\/K of Bacillus subtilis. The E. coli periplasmic chaperones, Skp and SurA, and BamA, the central subunit of the BAM complex, have been examined with respect to the folding kinetics of a model OMP (tOmpA) (Schiffrin et al. 2017), showing that prefolded BamA promotes the release of tOmpA from Skp, despite the nM affinity of the Skp for tOmpA. This activity is located in the BamA \u03b2-barrel domain, but is greater when full-length BamA is present, indicating that both the beta-barrel and POTRA domains are required for maximal activity. By contrast, SurA is unable to release tOmpA from Skp, providing direct evidence against a sequential chaperone model. BamA has a greater catalytic effect on tOmpA folding in thicker bilayers, suggesting that BAM catalysis involves lowering the kinetic barrier imposed by the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane (Schiffrin et al. 2017). While BamA is the primary translocator, TamB is involved in folding and maturation of autotransporters (Babu et al. 2018).","2":"PBDID: 2LAE  PBDID: 2LAF  PBDID: 2YH5  PBDID: 2YH6  PBDID: 3SNS  PBDID: 3TGO  PBDID: 5ayw  PBDID: 5d0o  PBDID: 5d0q  PBDID: 5ekq  PBDID: 5ljo  PBDID: 6V05  PBDID: 2KM7  PBDID: 2KXX  PBDID: 2YH9  PBDID: 5ayw  PBDID: 5d0o  PBDID: 5d0q  PBDID: 5ekq  PBDID: 5ljo  PBDID: 6V05  PBDID: 4c4v  PBDID: 4c4v  PBDID: 4n75  PBDID: 5ayw  PBDID: 5d0o  PBDID: 5d0q  PBDID: 5ekq  PBDID: 5ljo  PBDID: 2YHC  PBDID: 3Q5M  PBDID: 3TGO  PBDID: 5d0o  PBDID: 5d0q  PBDID: 5ekq  PBDID: 5ljo  PBDID: 5AYW  PBDID: 6V05  PBDID: 2YH3  PBDID: 2YMS  PBDID: 3P1L  PBDID: 3PRW  PBDID: 3Q7M  PBDID: 3Q7N  PBDID: 3Q7O  PBDID: 4PK1  PBDID: 5ayw  PBDID: 5d0o  PBDID: 5ljo  PBDID: 4XGA  PBDID: 6V05"},{"0":"1.B.33.2.4","1":"TamA (YftM) of 577 aas; has a 16 transmembrane \u03b2-stranded \u03b2-barrel with 3 PORTRA domains.

SusE and SusF do not constitute the major starch-binding proteins in the starch degradative pathway. SusF has lower affinity for starch compared to SusE (Shipman et al. 2000). The 3-d structure of the complex has been determined (Cameron et al. 2012).

LptDE (1:1 stoichiometry) comprise a two-protein \u03b2-barrel-lipoprotein complex in the outer membrane that assembles and exports LPS (Chng et al., 2010). After LPS (or a precursor) is transported across the inner membrane by MsbA (3.A.1.106.1), this seven component system translocates LPS from the outer surface of the inner membrane to the outer surface of the outer membrane using ATP hydrolysis to sequentially energize transfer from one binding site to another in several steps (Freinkman et al. 2012; Okuda et al. 2012; Sherman et al. 2014). LPS interacts with LptC and LptA sequentially before being passed to the LptD outer membrane porin, anchored by the LptE lipoprotein on the inner surface of the outer membrane. LptF and LptG are the transmembrane consituents of the ABC pump, and LptB is the ATPase of an ABC-like system that energizes the transport using several ATP molecules (Okuda et al. 2012; Sherman et al. 2014). LptC interconnects the LptBFG ABC system with the periplasmic LptA protein via its large periplasmic domain (Villa et al. 2013). LptDE form a complex in the outer membrane which inserts LPS into this membrane. The 3-D strcture of the complex shows that the LptE lipoprotein inserts into the 26 stranded barrel of LptD as a plug. The first two strands of LptD contain prolines and are therefore distorted, possibly creating a portal for lateral diffusion of LPS into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (Qiao et al. 2014). The 3-d structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LptA, LptH, has been solved at 2:75 \u00c5 resolution revealing a \u03b2-jellyroll fold similar to that in LptD (Bollati et al. 2015). Direct interaction of LptB and LptC has been demonstrated (Martorana et al. 2016). A specific binding site in the LptB ATPase for the coupling helices of the transmembrane LptFG complex is responsible for coupling ATP hydrolysis by LptB with LptFG function to achieve LPS extraction (Simpson et al. 2016). After biosynthesis, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are transiently anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (IM). The ABC transporter LptB2FG extracts LPSs from the IM and transports them to the outer membrane. Luo et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG from P. aeruginosa. It shows that LPS transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a TM domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction by LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (Luo et al. 2017). Transport involves a stable association between the inner (LptBFG) and outer (LptDE) membrane components, supporting a mechanism in which lipopolysaccharide molecules are pushed one after the other across a protein bridge (LptCA) that connects the inner and outer membranes (Sherman et al. 2018). The ABC transporter, LptB2FG, which tightly associates with LptC, extracts lipopolysaccharide out of the inner membrane.Li et al. 2019 characterized the structures of LptB2FG and LptB2FGC in nucleotide-free and vanadate-trapped states, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures resolve the bound lipopolysaccharide, reveal transporter-lipopolysaccharide interactions with side-chain details and uncover how the capture and extrusion of lipopolysaccharide are coupled to conformational rearrangements of LptB2FGC. LptC inserts its TMS between the two transmembrane domains of LptB2FG, which represents a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for ABC transporters. These results suggest a role for LptC in achieving efficient lipopolysaccharide transport, by coordinating the action of LptB2FG in the inner membrane and Lpt protein interactions in the periplasm (Li et al. 2019). cryo-EM structures of LptB2FG alone and complexed with LptC are known, revealing conformational changes between these states. Two functional transmembrane arginine-containing loops interact with bound AMP-PNP which induces an inward rotation and shift of the transmembrane helices of LptFG and LptC to tighten the cavity, with the closure of two lateral gates, to eventually expel LPS into the bridge (Tang et al. 2019). The ABC transporter, LptB2FGC extracts LPS from the inner membrane and places it onto a periplasmic protein bridge. Lundstedt et al. 2020 showed that residue E86 of LptB is essential for coupling the function of this ATPase to that of its membrane partners, LptFG, at the step where ATP binding drives the closure of the LptB dimer and the collapse of the LPS-binding cavity in LptFG that moves LPS to the Lpt periplasmic bridge consisting of LptC, A and D (from inside to out) and then to the outer membrane insertase, LptE. Defects caused by changing residue E86 are suppressed by mutations altering either the LPS structure or TMSs in LptG. These suppressors fix defects in the coupling helix of LptF, but not of LptG. These observations support a transport mechanism in which the ATP-driven movements of LptB and those of the substrate-binding cavity in LptFG are bi-directionally coordinated through the rigid-body coupling, with LptF's coupling helix being important in coordinating cavity collapse with LptB dimerization (Lundstedt et al. 2020). The TMS of LptC participates in LPS extraction by the LptB2 FGC transporter (Wilson and Ruiz 2022). A small molecule, IMB-0042, inhibits the interaction of LPS transporter proteins, LptA and LptC. This give rise to filament morphology, impaired OM integrity, and an accumulation of LPS in the periplasm (Dai et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2R19  PBDID: 2R1A  PBDID: 6GD5  PBDID: 4P31  PBDID: 4P32  PBDID: 4P33  PBDID: 6B89  PBDID: 6B8B  PBDID: 6MBN  PBDID: 6MGF  PBDID: 6MHU  PBDID: 6MHZ  PBDID: 6MI7  PBDID: 6MI8  PBDID: 4RHB  PBDID: 4q35  PBDID: 4NHR  PBDID: 4RH8  PBDID: 4RHB  PBDID: 4q35  PBDID: 6MHU  PBDID: 6MHZ  PBDID: 6MI7  PBDID: 6MI8  PBDID: 6MHU  PBDID: 6MHZ  PBDID: 6MI7  PBDID: 6MI8"},{"0":"1.B.45.1.1","1":"Treponema porin, TP0453 of 287 aas.

The 3-d structure of the human VDAC1 is known (PDB ID 2JK4; Bayrhuber et al. 2008). Reviewed by Shoshan-Barmatz et al. 2015. VDAC1 is found both in mitochondria and the plasma membrane (Lawen et al. 2005) where it may cause cytoplasmic ATP loss.. It may be involved in cancer (Shoshan-Barmatz et al. 2017) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Shoshan-Barmatz et al. 2018). Along with its low toxicity profile and high antioxidant activity, the gallic acid derivative, AntiOxBEN3, strongly inhibits calcium-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening (Teixeira et al. 2018). VDAC dimerization plays a role in mitochondrial metabolic regulation and apoptosis in response to cytosolic acidification during cellular stress, and E73 is involved (Bergdoll et al. 2018). Inhibiting VDAC1 overproduction and plasma membrane insertion in \u03b2-cells preserves insulin secretion in diabetes (Zhang et al. 2018). \u03b2II and \u03b2III-tubulin, bound to VDAC, regulate VDAC permeability (Puurand et al. 2019).

A method has been develped to determine the number of VDAC1 channels (and other integral membrane proteins) in nanodiscs under various assembly conditions (H\u00e4usler et al. 2020). Stable low-conducting states of human VDAC1 predominantly take place from disordered events and do not result from the displacement of a voltage sensor or a significant change in the pore. Conductance jumps reveal entropy as a key factor for VDAC gating (Preto et al. 2022).

A peptide derived from the putative transmembrane domain in the tail region of hemolysin E (aas 88-120) assembles in phospholipid membrane and exhibits lytic activity to human red blood cells (Yadav et al., 2009). Residues important for insertion and activity have been identified (Ludwig et al., 2010). An unusual assembly pathway has been proposed (see family description; Fahie et al. 2013). The pore can be blocked by PAMAM dendrimers (Mandal et al. 2016). The C-terminus directs pore formation and function (Sathyanarayana et al. 2016). Similar in structure to Cry6Aa (TC# 1.C.41.2.1) although sequence similarity could not be discerned (Dementiev et al. 2016 and unpublished results). The C-terminal domain is not directly involved in the pore structure, but is not a passive player in pore formation as it plays important roles in mediating the transition through intermediary steps leading to successful pore formation in a membrane (Sathyanarayana et al. 2016). Transmembrane oligomeric intermediates or \"arcs\" probably form stable proteolipidic complexes consisting of protein arcs with toroidal lipids lining the free edges (Desikan et al. 2017). High-resolution cryo-EM structures revealed that ClyA pore complexes can exist as oligomers of a tridecamer and a tetradecamer, at estimated resolutions of 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 and 4.3 \u00c5, respectively. The 2.8 A cryo-EM structure of a dodecamer dramatically improves the existing structural model. Structural analysis indicates that protomers from distinct oligomers resemble each other, and neighboring protomers adopt a conserved interaction mode. A stabilized intermediate state of ClyA during the transition process from soluble monomers to pore complexes was identified. Even without the formation of mature pore complexes, ClyA can permeabilize membranes and allow leakage of particles less than ~400 Daltons. In addition, ClyA forms pore complexes in the presence of cholesterol within artificial liposomes (Peng et al. 2019). The mechanism of pore formation has been reviewed (Sathyanarayana et al. 2020).

DCD assembles in solution into a hexameric pre-channel complex before targeting the membrane and integration, the complex follows a deviation of the barrel stave model (Zeth and Sancho-Vaello 2017).

Although homologous, HlyA (1.C.11.1.3) and CyaA exhibit different modes of permeabilization (Fiser and Konop\u00e1sek 2009). A pore model comprising three alpha2-loop-alpha3 hairpins suggested that Gly530XXGly533XXXGly537 in TMS2 could function in toxin oligomerization (Juntapremjit et al. 2015). Structural integrity of TMSs 1, 2, 3 and 5, but not 4, is important for haemolytic activity, particularly for transmembrane helices 2 and 3 that might form the pore (Powthongchin and Angsuthanasombat 2009). CyaA forms small cation-selective membrane pores that permeabilize cells for potassium efflux, contributing to cytotoxicity of CyaA and eventually provoking colloid-osmotic cell lysis (Wald et al. 2016). The toxin penetrates myeloid phagocytes expressing the complement receptor 3 and delivers into the cytosol its N-terminal adenylate cyclase enzyme domain (~400 residues). In parallel, the ~1300 residue-long RTX hemolysin moiety of CyaA permeabilizes target cell membranes for efflux of cytosolic potassium ions (Svedova et al. 2016). Positively-charged side-chains substituted at positions Gln574 and Glu581 in the pore-lining alpha3 enhance hemolytic activity and ion-channel opening, mimicing the highly-active RTX (repeat-in-toxin) cytolysins (Kurehong et al. 2017). Residues 529 to 549 participate in membrane penetration and pore-forming activity (Roderova et al. 2019). Two distinct conformers of CyaA appear to accomplish its two parallel activities within target cell membranes. The translocating conformer would deliver the N-terminal adenylyl cyclase domain into the cytosol of cells, while the pore precursor conformer would assemble into oligomeric cation-selective pores and permeabilize cellular membrane. Both toxin activities involve a membrane-interacting 'AC-to-Hly-linking segment' (residues 400 to 500). Two clusters of negatively charged residues within this linking segment (Glu419 to Glu432 and Asp445 to Glu448) regulate the balance between the AC domain translocating and pore-forming capacities of CyaA as a function of the calcium concentration (Sukova et al. 2020).

In the formation of the pore forming toxin, the elongated toxin monomer binds stably to the membrane in an \"end-on\" orientation, with its long axis approximately perpendicular to the plane of the membrane bilayer (Ramachandran et al. 2005). This orientation is largely retained, even after monomers associate to form an oligomeric prepore complex. The domain 3 (D3) polypeptide segments that ultimately form transmembrane beta-hairpins remain far above the membrane surface in both the membrane-bound monomer and prepore oligomer. Upon pore formation, these segments enter the bilayer, whereas D1 moves to a position that is substantially closer to the membrane. Therefore, the extended D2 beta-structure that connects D1 to membrane-bound D4 appears to bend or otherwise reconfigure during the prepore-to-pore transition of the perfringolysin O oligomer (Ramachandran et al. 2005). The prepore to pore transition has been visualized by electron microscopy (Dang et al. 2005). Phosphatidylcholine in the outer leaflet increases the cholesterol concentration required to induce PFO binding while phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of asymmetric vesicles stabilized the formation of a deeply inserted conformation that does not form pores, even though it contains transmembrane segments (Lin and London 2014). This conformation may represent an important intermediate stage in PFO pore formation. Cholesterol recognition, oligomerization, and the conformational changes involved in pore formation have been reviewed (Johnson and Heuck 2014), and the involvement of the D1 domain in structural transitions leading to pore formation has been studied (Kacprzyk-Stokowiec et al. 2014). Interaction of PFO with cholesterol is sufficient to initiate an irreversible sequence of coupled conformational changes that extend throughout the toxin molecule and induce pore formation (Heuck et al. 2007). Once this transmembrane beta-barrel protein is inserted, PFO assembles into pore-forming oligomers containing 30-50 PFO monomers. These form a pore of up to 300 \u00c5, far exceeding the size of most other proteinaceous pores. Decreasing the length of the \u03b2-strands causes the pore to shrink (Lin et al. 2015).

Movement of Domain 2 with respect to Domain 3 of ILY is essential for forming a late prepore intermediate that releases CD59, while the role of cholesterol may be limited to insertion of the TMSs (Boyd et al. 2016). The pore-forming regions are initially folded up on the surfaces of the soluble precursors.

GSDMD is activated by inflammasome-activated caspases-1\/-4\/-5\/-11 as well as a caspase-8-mediated pathway during Yersinia infection. These caspases cleave GSDMD to release its functional N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) from its auto-inhibitory C-terminal fragment (GSDMD-CT). GSDMD-NTs bind to acid lipids in mammalian cell membranes and bacterial membranes, oligomerize, and insert into the membranes to form large transmembrane pores. Consequently, cellular contents including inflammatory cytokines are released (e.g., IL-1\u03b2), and cells can undergo pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death (Xia et al. 2019; Muendlein et al. 2020). As organelles of the innate immune system, inflammasomes activate caspase-1 and other inflammatory caspases that cleave gasdermin D. Caspase-1 also cleaves inactive precursors of the interleukin (IL)-1 family to generate mature cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-18. Cleaved GSDMD forms transmembrane pores to enable the release of IL-1 and to drive cell lysis through pyroptosis. Cryo-EM structures of the pore and the prepore reveal the different conformations of the two states, as well as membrane-binding elements including a hydrophobic anchor and three positively charged patches. The pore conduit is predominantly negatively charged, but IL-1 precursors have an acidic domain that is proteolytically removed by caspase-1. When permeabilized, unlysed liposomes release positively charged and neutral cargoes faster than negatively charged cargoes of similar sizes, and the pores favor the passage of IL-1beta and IL-18 over that of their precursors (Xia et al. 2021). Gasdermin-A3 oligomers assemble on the membrane surface where they remain attached and mobile. Once inserted into the membrane it grows variable oligomeric stoichiometries and shapes, each able to open transmembrane pores. Molecular dynamics simulations resolved how the membrane-inserted amphiphilic beta-hairpins and the structurally adapting hydrophilic head domains stabilize variable oligomeric conformations and open the pore. Without a vertical collapse, gasdermin pore formation propagates along a set of multiple parallel but connected reaction pathways to ensure a robust cellular response (Mari et al. 2022). Roles of multiple charged residues in membrane insertion of gasdermin-A3 have been identified (Korn and Pluhackova 2022).","2":"PBDID: 5NH1  PBDID: 5WQT  PBDID: 6AO4  PBDID: 6KMZ  PBDID: 6KN0  PBDID: 6N9O"},{"0":"1.C.123.1.3","1":"Gasdermin B of 411 aas.

A cryo-electron microscopic study revealed low resolution structures for different functional forms (Dutta et al., 2009). Crystal structures of the soluble and transmembrane heptamer reveal common features among disparate pore-forming toxins (De and Olson, 2011). The toxin forms transmembrane heptameric \u03b2-barrel channels with two lectin activities on the \u03b2-prism and the \u03b2-trefoil (Rai et al. 2013). A ring of tryptophan residues forms the narrowest constriction in the transmembrane channel reminiscent of the phenylalanine clamp identified in anthrax protective antigen (Krantz et al., 2005). A single point mutation prevents membrane integration and pore formation (Paul and Chattopadhyay 2012). The deletion of the pre-stem segment does not affect membrane binding and pre-pore oligomer formation, but it critically abrogates the functional pore-forming activity of VCC (Paul and Chattopadhyay 2013). The membrane-bound monomer can not form pores (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2014). VCC can be delivered to host cells via extracellular bacterial vesicles (Elluri et al. 2014). Loops within the membrane-proximal region of VCC play critical roles in determining the functional interactions of the toxin with the membrane lipids that allow pore formation (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2015). VCC may interfer with signalling in the target cell as well as form pores (Khilwani and Chattopadhyay 2015). A functional map of the VCC membrane-binding surface has been published (De et al. 2015). Residues involved in oligomerization have been identified (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2016). The multiple membrane interaction mechanisms of VCC have been reviewed (Kathuria and Chattopadhyay 2018). A model of the transmembrane pore has been presented that accounts for some of its properties (Pantano and Montecucco 2006). An overview of the understanding regarding the membrane interaction mechanisms of VCC and their functional implications for the  pore-forming activity of the toxin have been reviewed (Kathuria and Chattopadhyay 2018). The specific cholesterol-binding ability of VCC does not appear to dictate its association with the cholesterol-rich micro-domains on human  erythrocytes but may be essential for formation of the membrane integraed pore structure (Gupta et al. 2022). Rather, targeting of VCC toward the membrane micro-domains of human erythrocytes possibly acts to facilitate the cholesterol-dependent pore-formation mechanism of the toxin (Cyr 2018). Tyrosine in the hinge region of the pore-forming motif regulates oligomeric beta-barrel pore formation (Mondal et al. 2020). Single-particle cryo-EM was used to characterize the structure of the VCC oligomer in large unilamellar vesicles. The rim domain amino acid residues of VCC interacting with lipid membrane were visualized. Cryo-EM views of lipid bilayer-embedded VCC suggested interesting conformational variabilities, especially in the transmembrane channel, which could have a potential impact on the pore architecture and assist in understanding the pore formation mechanism (Sengupta et al. 2021). The Glu289 residue in the pore-forming motif of VCC is important for efficient beta-barrel pore formation (Mondal et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1XEZ  PBDID: 3o44  PBDID: 4GX7"},{"0":"1.C.14.1.3","1":"Vibrio vulnificus hemolysin (VVH-A).

Oxoxylin A inhibits hemolysis by hindering self assembly of the hepatmeric pore in which two\u00a0\u03b2-strands are contributed by each subunit (Song et al. 1996; Dong et al. 2013). Applications of pore-forming \u03b1-haemolysin include small- and macromolecule-sensing, targeted cancer therapy, and drug delivery (Gurnev and Nestorovich 2014). Sugawara et al. 2015 studied pore formation. Structural comparisons among monomer, prepore and pore revealed a series of motions in which the N-terminal amino latch released upon oligomerization destroys its own key hydrogen bond betweem Asp45 and Try118. This action initiates the protrusion of the prestem. A Y118F mutant and the N-terminal truncated mutant markedly decreased the hemolytic activity, indicating the importance of the key hydrogen bond and the N-terminal amino latch for pore formation. A dynamic molecular mechanism of pore formation was proposed (Sugawara et al. 2015). Release of ATP from cells may occur directly through transmembrane pores formed by \u03b1-toxin (Baaske et al. 2016). The amino latch of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin functions in pore formation via an co-operative interaction between the N terminus and position 217 (Jayasinghe et al. 2006). PLEKHA7 and other junctional proteins are host factors mediating death by S. aureus alpha-toxin. ADAM10 is docked to junctions by its transmembrane partner  Tspan33, whose cytoplasmic C-terminus binds to the WW domain of PLEKHA7  in the presence of PDZD11. ADAM10 is locked at junctions through binding of its cytoplasmic C terminus to afadin. Junctionally clustered ADAM10 supports the efficient formation of stable toxin pores. Disruption of the PLEKHA7-PDZD11 complex inhibits ADAM10 and toxin junctional clustering. This promotes toxin pore removal from the cell surface through an actin- and macropinocytosis-dependent process, resulting in cell recovery from initial injury and survival. Thus, a dock-and-lock molecular mechanism targets ADAM10 to junctions, providing  a paradigm for how junctions may regulate transmembrane receptors through their clustering (Shah et al. 2018). Airway epithelial cells are sensitivity to S. aureus \u03b1-Toxin, but the toxin heptamers are removed by extracellular vesicle formation and lysosomal degradation (M\u00f6ller et al. 2021). The effect of electroosmotic solvent flow on the binding of a neutral molecule [beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD)] to sites within alpha-hemolysin pore was investigated. Mutant \u03b1-hemolysin pores were used to which betaCD can bind from either entrance and through which the direction of water flow can be controlled by choosing the charge selectivity of the pore and the polarity of the applied potential. The Kd values for betaCD for individual mutant pores varied by >100-fold with the applied potential over a range of -120 to +120 mV (Gu et al. 2003).","2":"PBDID: 7AHL  PBDID: 3M2L  PBDID: 3M3R  PBDID: 3M4D  PBDID: 3M4E  PBDID: 4IDJ  PBDID: 4YHD  PBDID: 3anz  PBDID: 6U3T  PBDID: 6U49  PBDID: 6U4P"},{"0":"1.C.3.2.4","1":"Necrotic enteritis toxin B precursor, NetB (Keyburn et al., 2008)","2":"PBDID: 4H56  PBDID: 4I0N"},{"0":"1.C.3.4.2","1":"Two component \u03b2-barrel \u03b3-haemolysin, HlgA\u00b7HlgB.

A model of the protegrin-1 pore has been presented, suggesting that permeability of water through a single PG-1 pore is sufficient to cause fast cell death by osmotic lysis (Langham et al. 2008). Possibly, toroidal pore formation is driven by guanidinium-phosphate complexation, where the cationic Arg residues drag the anionic phosphate groups along as they insert into the hydrophobic part of the membrane (Tang et al. 2007). Protegrin-1 is an 18-residue beta-hairpin antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that forms transmembrane beta-barrels in biological membranes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of various protegrin-1 oligomers on the membrane surface and in transmembrane topologies indicated that protegrin dimers are stable, whereas trimers and tetramers break down (Lipkin et al. 2017). Tetrameric arcs remained stably inserted in lipid membranes, but the pore water was displaced by lipid molecules. Unsheared protegrin beta-barrels opened into beta-sheets that surrounded stable aqueous pores, whereas tilted barrels with sheared hydrogen bonding patterns were stable in most topologies. A third type of pore consisted of multiple small oligomers surrounding a small, partially lipidic pore. Tachyplesin (TC# 1.C.34.1.1) showed less of a tendency to oligomerize than protegrin: the octameric bundle resulted in small pores surrounded by six peptides as monomers and dimers, with some peptides returning to the membrane surface. Theus, multiple configurations of protegrin oligomers may produce aqueous pores (Lipkin et al. 2017). PG-1 can insert into membranes provided that the external electric potential is large enough to first induce a water column or a pore within the lipid bilayer membrane. The highly charged PG-1 is capable, by itself, of inducing molecular electroporation (Lai and Kaznessis 2018).","2":"PBDID: 1PG1  PBDID: 1ZY6"},{"0":"1.C.34.1.1","1":"Tachyplesin I precursor.

Almost identical to Equinatoxin II (1.C.38.1.1) (Mechaly et al., 2011). Fragaceatoxin C (FraC) is an \u03b1-barrel pore-forming toxin (PFT). The crystal structures of FraC at four different stages of the lytic mechanism have been determined at 3.1\u00c5 resolution, namely the water-soluble state, the monomeric lipid-bound form, an assembly intermediate and the fully assembled transmembrane pore (Tanaka et al. 2015). The structure of the transmembrane pore exhibits a unique architecture composed of both protein and lipids, with some of the lipids lining the pore wall, acting as assembly cofactors. The pore exhibits lateral fenestrations that expose the hydrophobic core of the membrane to the aqueous environment. The incorporation of lipids from the target membrane within the structure of the pore provides a membrane-specific trigger for the activation of this haemolytic toxin. It has been reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers and engineered for DNA analysis. It shows a funnel-shaped geometry that allows tight wrapping around single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), resolving between homopolymeric C, T, and A polynucleotide stretches (Wloka et al. 2016). Despite the 1.2 nm internal constriction in the FraC pore, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can translocate through the nanopore at high applied potentials, presumably through deformation of the alpha-helical transmembrane region (Huang et al. 2017). Therefore, FraC nanopores might be useful for DNA sequencing and dsDNA analysis. Pore formation goes through a dimer intermediate and then generates the active octamer.

Subsequently, perforin-2 polymerizes and forms large clusters of 100\u00a0\u00c5 pores in the bacterial surface with perforin-2 cleavage products present in the bacteria. Perforin-2 is  also required for the bactericidal activity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as well as  hydrolytic enzymes (McCormack et al. 2015).  Perforin-2 exists in membrane-bound (P2a) and secretory (P2b) isoforms,  both present in human macrophages. P2a promotes fusion of vesicles with  lysosomes, and may therefore play important roles in immune defense (Xiong et al. 2017).  Loss of MPEG1 causes increased susceptibility to microbial infection. MPEG1 expression is upregulated in response to proinflammatory signals such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Furthermore, germline mutations in MPEG1 have been identified in connection with recurrent pulmonary mycobacterial infections.

Adenosine phosphates control the activity of lysenin channels inserted into planar lipid membranes with respect to their macroscopic conductance and voltage-induced gating. Addition of ATP, ADP, or AMP decreased the macroscopic conductance of lysenin channels in a concentration-dependent manner, with ATP being the  most potent inhibitor and AMP the least (Bryant et al. 2016). lysenin  can specifically interact with sphingomyelin, and may confer innate  immunity against parasites by attacking the membranes of the parasites to form pores (Pang et al. 2019). Upon binding to sphingomyelin (SM)-containing membranes, lysenin undergoes a series of structural changes promoting the conversion of water-soluble monomers into oligomers, leading to its insertion into the membrane and the 2-step formation of a lytic beta-barrel pore (Kulma et al. 2019). Structural stabilization of the lysenin prepore starts at the site of initial interaction with the lipid membrane and is transmitted to the twisted beta-sheet of the N-terminal domain (Kulma et al. 2019). 3-d structures are available (PDB# 5EC5; 3ZXD; 3ZX7). The beta pore-forming toxins (beta-PFTs) are cytotoxic proteins produced as soluble monomers, which cluster and oligomerize at the membrane of the target host cells.

Forms heptameric pores (Miyata et al. 2002). However, it has been reported to act on oligodendrocytes causing demyelination without forming pores (Wioland et al. 2015). The toxin acts on the brain, affecting vascular permeability, but also damaging neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Freedman et al. 2016). The pore-forming regions are initially folded up on the surfaces of the soluble precursors. To create the transmembrane pores, these regions must extend and refold into membrane-inserted beta-barrels (Tilley and Saibil 2006). The crystal structure of epsilon-toxin revealed structural similarity to aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila.(Cole et al. 2004). Residues in the central position of each beta-strand of the amphipathic beta-hairpin loop that forms the transmembrane pore, control the size and ion selectivity of the channel (Knapp et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 6RB9"},{"0":"1.C.50.1.1","1":"Alzheimer''s disease (AD) amyloid \u03b2-protein (amino acids 1-42) (Abeta protein or A\u03b2P or A\u03b242). A\u03b2 pores may consist of tetrameric and hexameric beta-sheet subunits (Strodel et al. 2010). Residues 22 - 35 in the peptide binds cholesterol to form Ca2+-permeable pores (Di Scala et al. 2014). Cholesterol promotes the insertion of Abeta in the plasma membrane, induces alpha-helical structure formation, and forces the peptide to adopt a tilted topology that favours oligomerization. Bexarotene, an amphipathic drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, competes with cholesterol for binding to Abeta and prevents oligomeric channel formation (Di Scala et al. 2014). The beta-amyloid protein is involved in the activation of the nAChRalpha7 receptor (Hassan et al. 2019). Tryptophan enantiomers (d\/l-Trp) introduced into artificial nanochannels regulate the chiral selective transport of Abeta proteins; the l-Trp channel shows selectivity for the transport of Abeta protein (Zhu et al. 2020). The prevalence, presentation, and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)  differ between men and women, although \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition is a pathological hallmark of AD in both sexes. A\u03b2-induced activation of the neuronal glutamate receptor mGluR5 is linked to AD progression. However, mGluR5 exhibits distinct sex-dependent profiles (Abd-Elrahman et al. 2020). mGluR5 isolated from male mouse cortical and hippocampal tissues bound with high affinity to A\u03b2 oligomers, whereas mGluR5 from female mice exhibited no such affinity. This sex-selective A\u03b2-mGluR5 interaction is not depend on estrogen, but rather A\u03b2 interaction with cellular prion protein (PrPC), which was detected only in male mouse brain homogenates. The ternary complex between mGluR5, A\u03b2 oligomers, and PrPC was essential to elicit mGluR5-dependent pathological suppression of autophagy in primary neuronal cultures. Pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 reactivated autophagy, mitigated A\u03b2 pathology, and reversed cognitive decline in male APPswe\/PS1\u0394E9 mice, but not in their female counterparts. A\u03b2 oligomers also bound with high affinity to human mGluR5  isolated from postmortem donor male cortical brain tissue, but not that  from female samples, suggesting that this mechanism may be relevant to patients. mGluR5 does not contribute to A\u03b2 pathology in females, highlighting the complexity of mGluR5 pharmacology  and A\u03b2 signaling that supports the need for sex-specific stratification  in clinical trials assessing AD therapeutics (Abd-Elrahman et al. 2020). Proteins associated with or anchored to the plasma membrane are associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in AD (Remnest\u00e5l et al. 2021). The architecture of the Alzheimer's A beta P ion channel pore has been determined (Arispe 2004). A transmembrane annular polymeric structure may be responsible for the ion channel properties of the membrane-bound A beta P (Arispe 2004). Arispe 2004 synthesized peptides that encompass the histidine dyad (H-H) hypothesized to line the pore and showed that peptides designed to most closely match the proposed pore are the most effective at blocking ion currents through the membrane-incorporated A beta P channel. Abeta) proteins can form ion pores in the cell membrane, and the structure of the transmembrane domain of Abeta ion channels is known. Substances that block or inhibit the formation of Abeta ion channels are known, and zinc ions are considered as potential inhibitors of AD (Kim et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 1NMJ  PBDID: 1OQN  PBDID: 1M7E  PBDID: 2LI9"},{"0":"1.C.50.1.2","1":"The Alzheimer\u2019s disease amyloid precursor \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2peptide; precursor: App,\u00a0\u03b3-secretase) (42aas) (3-d structure is known from NMR spectroscopy (1Z0Q_A; Jang et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008)).

Pleurotolysin A (PlyA; also called ostreolysin A, OlyA) binds first in a sphingomyelin-dependent process; Pleurotolysin B (PlyS) binds to A in the membrane and inserts (Kondos et al., 2011). The binary cytolytic pore-forming complex forms non-selective ion conducting pores of variable size (Schlumberger et al. 2013) to promote fruiting (Ota et al. 2014). Conformational changes accompanying pore formation have been reported (Lukoyanova et al. 2015). In these systems, the aegerolysin-like proteins provide the membrane cholesterol\/sphingomyelin selectivity and recruit oligomerised pleurotolysin B molecules, to create a membrane-inserted pore complex. The resulting protein structure has been imaged with electron microscopy, and it has a 13-meric rosette-like structure, with a central  lumen that is ~4-5\u00a0nm in diameter. The opened transmembrane pore is non-selectively permeable for ions and smaller neutral solutes, and is a cause of cytolysis of a colloid-osmotic type (Ota et al. 2014). Ostreolysin A6 (OlyA6) is a protein produced by the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus). It binds to membrane sphingomyelin\/cholesterol domains, and together with its protein partner, pleurotolysin B (PlyB), it forms 13-meric transmembrane pore complexes. OlyA6 binds 1000 times more strongly to the insect-specific membrane sphingolipid, ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE). In concert with PlyB, OlyA6 has potent and selective insecticidal activity against the western corn rootworm.\u00a0Milija\u0161 Joti\u00c4\u0087 et al. 2021 analysed the histological alterations of the midgut wall columnar epithelium of western corn rootworm larvae fed with OlyA6\/PlyB, which showed vacuolisation of the cell cytoplasm, swelling of the apical cell surface into the gut lumen, and delamination of the basal lamina underlying the epithelium. Cryo-EM was used to explore the membrane interactions of the OlyA6\/PlyB complex using lipid vesicles composed of artificial lipids containing CPE, and western corn rootworm brush border membrane vesicles. Multimeric transmembrane pores were formed in both vesicle preparations, similar to those described for sphingomyelin\/cholesterol membranes. Thus, the molecular mechanism of insecticidal action of OlyA6\/PlyB arises from specific interactions of OlyA6 with CPE, and the consequent formation of transmembrane pores in the insect midgut (Milija\u0161 Joti\u00c4\u0087 et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 4OEB  PBDID: 4V2T  PBDID: 4V3A  PBDID: 4V3M  PBDID: 4V3N  PBDID: 4OEJ  PBDID: 4OV8  PBDID: 4V2T  PBDID: 4V3A  PBDID: 4V3M  PBDID: 4V3N"},{"0":"1.C.97.3.2","1":"Pore-forming ostreolysin (Berne et al., 2005). 97% identical to Erylysin A (1.C.97.1.2).","2":"PBDID: 6MYI  PBDID: 6MYJ  PBDID: 6MYK"},{"0":"1.C.98.1.1","1":"The heterotrimeric CDT, CdtA\/B\/C toxin complex.

Ca2+ acts on the synaptic vesicle synaptotagmin1 (synaptotagmin I; SytI, Syt1, SSVP65, SYT) to trigger rapid exocytosis (Chapman, 2008). Syt1 is a major Ca2+ sensor for fast neurotransmitter release. It contains tandem Ca2+-binding C2 domains (C2AB), a single transmembrane \u03b1-helix and a highly charged 60-residue- long linker in between. The linker region of Syt1 is essential for its two signature functions: Ca2+-independent vesicle docking and Ca2+-dependent fusion pore opening. The linker contains the basic-amino acid-rich N-terminal region and the acidic amino acid-rich C-terminal region (Lai et al. 2013). The intrinsically disordered region between Syt I's transmembrane helix and the first C2 domain interats with vesicular lipids and modulates Ca2+ binding to C2 (Fealey et al. 2016). t-SNARE and v-SNARE interact in their C-terminal TMSs to promote pore opening (Wu et al. 2016). Both sides of a trans-SNARE complex can drive pore opening suggesting an indentation model in which multiple SNARE C-termini cooperate in opening the fusion pore by locally deforming the inner leaflets (D'Agostino et al. 2016). The TMSs of SNARE proteins regulate the fusion process (Wu et al. 2017). The cysteine-rich domain of SNAP-23 regulates its membrane association and exocytosis from mast cells (Agarwal et al. 2019). Snc1 is trafficked between the endosomal system and the Golgi apparatus via multiple pathways, providing evidence for protein quality control surveillance of a SNARE protein in the endo-vacuolar system (Ma and Burd 2019).

Considering these last three proteins, SNARE TMSs serve as non-specific membrane anchors in vacuole fusion, but fusion requires the SNARE complexes in the plasma and vacuolar membranes. Lipid-anchored Vti1 was fully active, lipid-anchored Nyv1 (R-SNARE) permitted the fusion reaction to proceed up to hemifusion, but lipid-anchored Vam3 interfered with fusion before hemifusion. Vam7 (a soluble SNARE; 316 aas) and Sec18 (758 aas) remodel SNARE compexes to allow lipd-anchored R-SNARE (NYV1, 253 aas), acting with Q-SNARE (VTS1; 523 aas), to support vacuole fusion (Jun et al. 2007).Thus, these proteins have non-specific membrane anchors, but each of these proteins makes different contributions to the hemifusion intermediate and opening of the fusion pore (Semenov et al. 2014). The 181-198 region of Qa-snare, immediately upstream of the SNARE heptad-repeat domain, is required for normal fusion activity with HOPS. This region is needed for normal SNARE complex assembly (Song and Wickner 2017). Sec17 and Sec18 act twice in the fusion cycle, binding to trans-SNARE complexes to accelerate fusion, and then to hydrolyze ATP to disassemble cis-SNARE complexes (Song et al. 2017).

SNARE TMSs may function as parts of the fusion pores during Ca2+-triggered exocytosis for release of both neurotransmitters and hormones (Chiang et al. 2018).

Autophagic vacuoles directed against GAS, termed GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs), use recycling endosomes (REs) as a membrane source. This complex mediates fusion between GcAVs and REs. STX6 (syntaxin 6) is recruited to GcAVs and forms a complex with VTI1B and VAMP3 to regulate the GcAV-RE fusion that is required for xenophagy. STX6 targets the GcAV membrane through its tyrosine-based sorting motif and transmembrane domain, and localizes to TFRC (transferrin receptor)-positive punctate structures on GcAVs through its H2 SNARE domain. STX6 is required for the fusion between GcAVs and REs to promote clearance of intracellular GAS by autophagy.

The small, myristoylated N-terminal ectodomain of p15 lacks any of the defining features of a typical viral fusion protein. NMR and CD spectroscopy indicated that this small fusion module (residues 68 - 87) comprises a left-handed polyproline type II (PPII) helix flanked by small, unstructured N- and C-termini (PDB# 2MNS_A). Individual prolines in the 6-residue proline-rich motif are tolerant to alanine substitutions, but multiple substitutions that disrupt the PPII helix eliminate cell-cell fusion activity. A synthetic p15 ectodomain peptide induces lipid mixing between liposomes. Lipid mixing, liposome  aggregation, and stable peptide-membrane interactions are all dependent  on both the N-terminal myristate and the presence of the PPII helix. A model for the mechanism of action of this viral fusion peptide, whereby the N-terminal myristate mediates initial, reversible peptide-membrane binding that is stabilized by subsequent amino acid-membrane interactions. These interactions induce a biphasic membrane fusion reaction, with peptide-induced liposome aggregation representing a distinct, rate-limiting event that precedes membrane merger. The PPII helix may function to force solvent exposure of hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the regions flanking the helix to promote membrane binding, apposition, and fusion (Top et al. 2012). A fusion-inducing lipid packing sensor (FLiPS) in the cytosolic endodomain in the p15 fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein is essential for pore formation during cell-cell fusion and syncytiogenesis (Read et al. 2015).

The  precursor is then proteolytically cleaved in the trans-Golgi and thereby activated by cellular furin or furin-like proteases to produce gp120 and gp41.

Complete fusion occurs in host cell endosomes and is dynamin-dependent, however some lipid transfer might occur at the plasma membrane.

Import of integral membrane proteins (mono- and polytopic) into the the inner nuclear membrane occurs by an active, transport factor-dependent process (Laba et al. 2015). Ndc1 and Pom52 are partially redundant NPC components that are essential for proper assembly of the NPC. The absence of Ndc1p and Pom152p results in aberrant pores that have enlarged diameters and lack proteinaceous material, leading to increased diffusion between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Madrid et al. 2006). Pom152 is a transmembrane protein within the nuclear pore complex (NPC) of fungi that is important for NPC assembly and structure. Pom152 is comprised of a short amino-terminal region that remains on the cytosolic side of the nuclear envelope (NE) and interacts with NPC proteins, a transmembrane domain, and a large, glycosylated carboxy-terminal domain within the NE lumen. Here we show that the N-terminal 200 amino acids of Pom152 that include only the amino-terminal and transmembrane regions are sufficient for localization to the NPC (Brown et al. 2021).

NPCs mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport and gain transport selectivity through nucleoporin FG domains.\u00a0Chug et al. 2015 reported a structural analysis of the frog FG Nup62\u202258\u202254 complex. It comprises a \u224813 nanometer-long trimerization interface with an unusual 2W3F coil, a canonical heterotrimeric coiled coil, and a kink that enforces a compact  six-helix bundle. Nup54 also contains a ferredoxin-like domain.\u00a0Chug et al. 2015 further identified a heterotrimeric Nup93-binding module for NPC anchorage. The quaternary structure alternations in the Nup62 complex, which were previously proposed to trigger a general gating of the NPC, are incompatible with the trimer structure.\u00a0Chug et al. 2015 suggested that the highly elongated Nup62 complex projects barrier-forming FG repeats far into the  central NPC channel, supporting a barrier that guards the entire cross section. The Sun1\/UNC84A protein and Sun2\/UNC84B may function redundantly in early HIV-1 infection steps and therefore influence HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis (Schaller et al. 2017). The integral transmembrane nucleoporin Pom121 functionally links nuclear pore complex assembly to nuclear envelope formation (Antonin et al. 2005) and ensures efficient HIV-1 pre-integration complex nuclear import (Guo et al. 2018). Mechanosensing at the nuclear envelope by nuclear pore complex stretch activation involves cell membrane integrins (TC# 8.A.54) and SUN proteins, SUN1 and SUN2, in the nuclear membrane (Donnaloja et al. 2019). TMX2 is a thioredoxin-like protein that facilitates the transport of proteins across the nuclear membrane (Oguro and Imaoka 2019). Torsin ATPase deficiency leads to defects in nuclear pore biogenesis and sequestration of the myelokd leukemia factor 2, MLF2 (Rampello et al. 2020). Cdk1 (CDC2, CDC2.8A, CDKN1, P34CDC2) acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes and facilitates its cell entry (Lupberger et al. 2011). G4C2 repeat RNA initiates a POM121-mediated reduction in specific nucleoporins (Coyne et al. 2020) (Pom121: acc# A8CG34). Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport and accumulation of specific nuclear-pore-complex-associated proteins play roles in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including C9orf72 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS\/FTD). Using super-resolution structured illumination microscopy, Coyne et al. 2020 have explored the mechanism by which nucleoporins are altered in nuclei isolated from C9orf72 induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons (iPSNs). Of the 23 nucleoporins evaluated, they observed a reduction in a subset of 8, including key components of the nuclear pore complex scaffold and the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121. Reduction in POM121 appeared to initiate a decrease in the expression of seven additional nucleoporins, ultimately affecting the localization of the Ran GTPase and subsequent cellular toxicity in C9orf72 iPSNs. Thus, the expression of expanded C9orf72 ALS\/FTD repeat RNA affects nuclear POM121 expression in the initiation of a pathological cascade affecting nucleoporin levels within neuronal nuclei and ultimately downstream neuronal survival (Coyne et al. 2020). Involved in the organization of the nuclear envelope, implicating EMD, SUN1 and A-type lamina (Gudise et al. 2011), but it also promotes breast cancer metastasis by positively regulating TGFbeta signaling (Kong et al. 2021). Nucleoporin POM121 signals TFEB-mediated autophagy via activation of the SIGMAR1\/sigma-1 receptor chaperone by pridopidine (Wang et al. 2022). AI-based structural prediction empowers integrative structural analysis of human nuclear pores (Mosalaganti et al. 2022). With a molecular weight of approximately 120 MDa, the human NPC is one of the largest protein complexes. Its ~1000 proteins are taken in multiple copies from a set of about 30 distinct nucleoporins (NUPs). They can be roughly categorized into two classes. Scaffold NUPs contain folded domains and form a cylindrical scaffold architecture around a central channel. Intrinsically disordered NUPs line the scaffold and extend into the central channel where they interact with cargo complexes. The NPC architecture is highly dynamic. It responds to changes in nuclear envelope tension with conformational breathing that manifests in dilation and constriction movements. AI-based predictions generated an extensive repertoire of structural models of human NUPs and their subcomplexes (Mosalaganti et al. 2022). The 70-MDa atomically resolved model covers >90% of the human NPC scaffold. It captures conformational changes that occur during dilation and constriction. It also reveals the precise anchoring sites for intrinsically disordered NUPs, the identification of which is a prerequisite for a complete and dynamic model of the NPC. This exempli-fies how AI-based structure predictions may accelerate the elucidation of subcellular architecture at atomic resolution. .","2":"PBDID: 2EC1  PBDID: 3TJ3  PBDID: 5T6W  PBDID: 3CQC  PBDID: 3CQG  PBDID: 3I4R  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 2EBQ  PBDID: 2EBR  PBDID: 2EBV  PBDID: 2GQE  PBDID: 4U0C  PBDID: 4U0D  PBDID: 5TSV  PBDID: 5TSX  PBDID: 6AYA  PBDID: 5IJN  PBDID: 5IJO  PBDID: 5IJN  PBDID: 5IJO  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 5IJN  PBDID: 5IJO  PBDID: 4LIR  PBDID: 1XKS  PBDID: 3CQC  PBDID: 3CQG  PBDID: 3I4R  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 1F59  PBDID: 1IBR  PBDID: 1M5N  PBDID: 1O6O  PBDID: 1O6P  PBDID: 1QGK  PBDID: 1QGR  PBDID: 2P8Q  PBDID: 2Q5D  PBDID: 2QNA  PBDID: 3LWW  PBDID: 3W5K  PBDID: 6N88  PBDID: 6N89  PBDID: 1RRP  PBDID: 1XKE  PBDID: 1Z5S  PBDID: 3UIN  PBDID: 3UIO  PBDID: 3UIP  PBDID: 4GA0  PBDID: 4I9Y  PBDID: 4L6E  PBDID: 4LQW  PBDID: 5CLL  PBDID: 5CLQ  PBDID: 2LAS  PBDID: 2OIT  PBDID: 3FHC  PBDID: 3FMO  PBDID: 3FMP  PBDID: 5DIS  PBDID: 5TO5  PBDID: 5TO6  PBDID: 5TO7  PBDID: 5TVB  PBDID: 5IJN  PBDID: 5IJO  PBDID: 4DHX  PBDID: 4I79  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 6B4F  PBDID: 6B4I  PBDID: 6B4J  PBDID: 3BG0  PBDID: 3BG1  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 6B4F  PBDID: 6B4I  PBDID: 6B4J  PBDID: 2JDQ  PBDID: 3TJ3  PBDID: 4B18  PBDID: 5IJO  PBDID: 1QBK  PBDID: 2H4M  PBDID: 2OT8  PBDID: 2QMR  PBDID: 2Z5J  PBDID: 2Z5K  PBDID: 2Z5M  PBDID: 2Z5N  PBDID: 2Z5O  PBDID: 4FDD  PBDID: 4FQ3  PBDID: 4JLQ  PBDID: 4OO6  PBDID: 5J3V  PBDID: 5TQC  PBDID: 5YVG  PBDID: 5YVH  PBDID: 5YVI  PBDID: 6XTE  PBDID: 6XU2  PBDID: 1Z5S  PBDID: 2GRN  PBDID: 2GRO  PBDID: 2GRP  PBDID: 2GRQ  PBDID: 2GRR  PBDID: 2IY0  PBDID: 3UIN  PBDID: 3UIO  PBDID: 3UIP  PBDID: 5D2M  PBDID: 2IO2  PBDID: 2IO3  PBDID: 6R15  PBDID: 6R16  PBDID: 6R2I  PBDID: 1Y7X  PBDID: 5XAH  PBDID: 5XBK  PBDID: 4UAE  PBDID: 5TBK  PBDID: 5XZX  PBDID: 6BVV  PBDID: 6BVZ  PBDID: 6BW9  PBDID: 6BWA  PBDID: 6BWB  PBDID: 7JJL  PBDID: 2X19  PBDID: 2XWU  PBDID: 3ZJY  PBDID: 1TGZ  PBDID: 1TH0  PBDID: 2IO0  PBDID: 2IO1  PBDID: 2IO2  PBDID: 2IO3  PBDID: 3ZO5  PBDID: 5AEK  PBDID: 3EWS  PBDID: 3FHC  PBDID: 3FHT  PBDID: 3FMO  PBDID: 3FMP  PBDID: 3G0H  PBDID: 6B4I  PBDID: 6B4J  PBDID: 6B4K  PBDID: 6N1Z  PBDID: 2RF5  PBDID: 3UDD  PBDID: 3UH2  PBDID: 3UH4  PBDID: 4DVI  PBDID: 4I9I  PBDID: 4K4E  PBDID: 4K4F  PBDID: 4KRS  PBDID: 4LI6  PBDID: 4LI7  PBDID: 4LI8  PBDID: 4MSG  PBDID: 4MSK  PBDID: 4MT9  PBDID: 4N3R  PBDID: 4N4V  PBDID: 4OA7  PBDID: 4TOR  PBDID: 4TOS  PBDID: 4U6A  PBDID: 4UUH  PBDID: 4UW1  PBDID: 4W5S  PBDID: 4W6E  PBDID: 5ECE  PBDID: 5EBT  PBDID: 5ETY  PBDID: 5GP7  PBDID: 5JHQ  PBDID: 5JTI  PBDID: 5JU5  PBDID: 5KNI  PBDID: 6QXU  PBDID: 6URQ  PBDID: 4UAD  PBDID: 1W9C  PBDID: 2L1L  PBDID: 3GB8  PBDID: 4BSM  PBDID: 4BSN  PBDID: 5DIS  PBDID: 6TVO  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 4WHJ  PBDID: 4X0R  PBDID: 5UOT  PBDID: 3A6P  PBDID: 5YU6  PBDID: 5YU7  PBDID: 1EFX  PBDID: 1QGK  PBDID: 1QGR  PBDID: 3FEX  PBDID: 3FEY  PBDID: 3WPT  PBDID: 4E4V  PBDID: 4WV6  PBDID: 5H43  PBDID: 3MMY  PBDID: 4OWR  PBDID: 2B9R  PBDID: 2JGZ  PBDID: 4Y72  PBDID: 4YC3  PBDID: 5HQ0  PBDID: 5LQF  PBDID: 6GU2  PBDID: 6GU3  PBDID: 6GU4  PBDID: 5J7E  PBDID: 4BYF  PBDID: 3ZKE  PBDID: 3ZKF  PBDID: 3CPF  PBDID: 5DLQ  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 2WQM  PBDID: 2WQN  PBDID: 5DE2  PBDID: 6NPY  PBDID: 6S73  PBDID: 6S75  PBDID: 6S76  PBDID: 4Y72  PBDID: 4YC6  PBDID: 4YC3  PBDID: 5HQ0  PBDID: 5LQF  PBDID: 6GU2  PBDID: 6GU3  PBDID: 6GU4  PBDID: 6GU6  PBDID: 6GU7  PBDID: 2I4I  PBDID: 2JGN  PBDID: 3JRV  PBDID: 4O2C  PBDID: 4O2E  PBDID: 4O2F  PBDID: 4PX9  PBDID: 4PXA  PBDID: 5E7I  PBDID: 5E7J  PBDID: 5E7M  PBDID: 6CZ5  PBDID: 6O5F  PBDID: 4DHX  PBDID: 4JO7  PBDID: 4JO9  PBDID: 4JQ5  PBDID: 5IJN  PBDID: 5IJO  PBDID: 4JNU  PBDID: 4JNV  PBDID: 4JO7  PBDID: 4JO9  PBDID: 5IJN  PBDID: 5IJO  PBDID: 4U2X  PBDID: 5Z2S  PBDID: 5Z2T  PBDID: 5Z6Z  PBDID: 5ZFW  PBDID: 5ZFY  PBDID: 5ZFZ  PBDID: 6A8R  PBDID: 6DFY  PBDID: 6E8C  PBDID: 6U81  PBDID: 6U82  PBDID: 1KO6  PBDID: 2Q5X  PBDID: 2Q5Y  PBDID: 3MMY  PBDID: 4OWR  PBDID: 5A9Q  PBDID: 6BZM  PBDID: 3UNP  PBDID: 4DXR  PBDID: 4DXS  PBDID: 4DXT  PBDID: 4FI9  PBDID: 2DJ0"},{"0":"1.I.1.1.5","1":"The nuclear envelope consists of the outer and the inner nuclear membrane, the nuclear lamina and the nuclear pore complexes, which regulate nuclear import and export (Batsios et al. 2019).

Sun1 and Src1 are nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins involved in the centrosome-nucleus connection and nuclear envelope stability at the nucleolar regions, respectively. In conjunction with a KASH-domain protein, Sun1 usually forms a so-called LINC complex. Two proteins with functions reminiscent of KASH-domain proteins at the outer nuclear membrane of Dictyostelium are known; interaptin which serves as an actin connector and the kinesin Kif9 which plays a role in the microtubule-centrosome connector, both of which lack the conserved KASH-domain. The link of the centrosome to the nuclear envelope is essential for the insertion of the centrosome into the nuclear envelope and appropriate spindle formation.

The results suggest a proton donor\/acceptor pair that links sugar transport to proton translocation.

The proteins from rat and cow have been crystalized and their structures have been determined in the open outward- and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. On the basis of comparisons of the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, a single point mutation proved to be enough to switch the substrate-binding preference from fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of E. coli XylE suggested that, in addition to a global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices, TM7 and TM10, underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism (Nomura et al. 2015). GLUT5 is preferentially used for fructose uptake under (near) anoxic glycolysis to avoid feedback inhibition of phosphofructokinase (Park et al. 2017). Residues involved in fructose recognition have been identified (Ebert et al. 2017).

Transports D-glucose, dehydroascorbate, arsenite and the flavonone, quercetin, via one pathway and water via a distinct channel. Sugar transport has been suggested to function via a sliding mechanism involving several sugar binding sites (Cunningham et al., 2006). Glut1 is the receptor for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)) (Manel et al., 2003). The orientation of the 12 TMSs and the conformation of the exofacial glucose binding site of GLUT1 have been proposed (Mueckler and Makepeace 2004). It is regulated by stomatin (TC# 8.A.21) to take up dehydroascorbate (Montel-Hagen et al., 2008). Mutations cause Glut1 deficiency syndrome, a human encephalopathy that results from decreased glucose flux through the blood brain barrier (Pascual et al., 2008). Mueckler and Makepeace (2009) have presented a model of the exofacial substrate-binding site and helical folding of Glut1. Glut1, 2, 4 and 9 are functional both in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (Takanaga and Frommer, 2010). Glut1 is down-regulated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (Liu et al., 2008b).\u00a0Metabolic stress rapidly stimulates blood-brain barrier endothelial cell sugar transport by acute up-regulation of plasma membrane GLUT1 levels, possibly involving an AMP-activated kinase activity (Cura and Carruthers, 2010). Serves as a receptor for neuropilin-1 (923aas; 2 TMSs; O14786) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Hoshino, 2012). Glut1 has a nucleotide binding site, and nucleotide binding affects transport activity (Yao and Bajjalieh 2009). The protein serves as a receptor for dermatin and \u03b2-adducin which help link the spectrin-actin junctional complex to the erythrocyte plasma membrane (Khan et al. 2008). May play a role in paroxysmal dyskinesias (Erro et al. 2017). GLUT1 mediates infection of CD4+ lymphocytes by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (Jin et al. 2006). Mutations in disordered regions can cause disease by introducing dileucine motifs, For example, mutations that are causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome are of this type and the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments (Meyer et al. 2018). Glucose transits along a transmembrane pathway through significant rotational motions while maintaining hydrogen bonds with the protein (Galochkina et al. 2019). It is phosphoryated by protein kinase C-B (TC# 8.A.104.1.4) (Lee et al. 2015). GLUT1-mediated exchange of fluorosugars has been studied (Shishmarev et al. 2018). Resveratrol and soy isoflavones alone and in combination improve the learning and memory of aging rats. The mechanism may be related to up-regulating the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 genes in the hippocampus (Zhang et al. 2020). The pore diameters of the transmembrane glucose transporters of all Class I GLUT proteins are constricted upon depletion of unsaturated fatty acids in the membranes (Weijers 2020). Diclofenac inhibits tumor cell glycolysis and growth by decreasing GLUT1 expression (Yang et al. 2021). Almost the entire populations of Glut1 and three other transmembrane proteins are immobilized by either the incorporation within large multiprotein complexes or entrapment within the protein network of the cortical spectrin cytoskeleton (Kodippili et al. 2020). This system is required for hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and metastasis (Fang et al. 2021). The main triggers FoR activation of transport are located within the solvent accessible linker regions in the extramembranous zones (Gonzalez-Resines et al. 2021). DHHC9-mediated GLUT1 S-palmitoylation is requuired for plasma membrane localization and promotes glioblastoma glycolysis and tumorigenesis (Zhang et al. 2021). An ancient family of arrestin-fold proteins, termed alpha-arrestins, have conserved roles in regulating nutrient transporter trafficking and  cellular metabolism as adaptor proteins. One alpha-arrestin, TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein), is known to regulate myocardial glucose uptake, but the in vivo role of the related alpha-arrestin,  ARRDC4 (arrestin domain-containing protein 4), was unknown. Interaction of ARRDC4 with GLUT1 prove to mediate metabolic stress in the ischemic heart (Nakayama et al. 2022). Mercury (Hg2+) decreased membrane deformability impairing RBC capacity to deal with the shear forces in the circulation, increasing membrane fragmentation, and affecting transport (Notariale et al. 2022). GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 play important roles in the development of some types of malignant tumors, including glioblastoma, and expression of both is regulated by miRNAs (Beylerli et al. 2022). Glucose uptake inhibitors via Glut1 are potential anticancer agents (Hung et al. 2022). GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS1) is a rare genetic metabolic disease, characterized by infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, and movement disorders (e.g., spasticity and dystonia) (Mauri et al. 2022). It is caused by heterozygous mutations in the SLC2A1 gene, which encodes the GLUT1 protein, a glucose transporter across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Most commonly, these variants (<2 dozen) arise de novo, resulting in sporadic cases, although several familial cases with AD inheritance pattern have been described (Mauri et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1SUK  PBDID: 4PYP  PBDID: 5eqg  PBDID: 5EQH  PBDID: 5EQI"},{"0":"2.A.1.1.3","1":"Xylose (xylopyranose):H+ symporter of 491 aas and 12 TMSs (Wambo et al. 2017).

Most of the sugar-binding residues are conserved with the human Glut-1, 2, 3 and 4 homologues. The coalescence of intramolecular tunnels and cavities has been postulated to account for facilitated diffusion of sugars (Cunningham and Naftalin 2014). Protonation of a conserved aspartate triggers a conformational transition from the outward-facing to the inward-facing state. This transition only occurs in the presence of substrate xylose, while the inhibitor glucose locks the transporter in the outward-facing state (Jia et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 4GBY  PBDID: 4GBZ  PBDID: 4GC0  PBDID: 4JA3  PBDID: 4JA4  PBDID: 4QIQ  PBDID: 6N3I"},{"0":"2.A.1.1.37","1":"The glucose\/fructose facilitator, Glut7 (SLC2A7) (a single mutation, I314V, results in loss of fructose transport but retention of glucose transport (Manolescu et al., 2005)","2":"PBDID: 1YG7"},{"0":"2.A.1.1.91","1":"Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 3 (Glucose transporter type 3, brain) (GLUT-3 or GLUT3).

SLC2A3 may play a role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) classical pathway as well as PD-L1 mediated immune responses (Gao et al. 2021).

Crystals that diffracted to 3.4 \u00c5 resolution and belonged to the hexagonal space group P6122 have been obtained (Nagarathinam et al. 2017). For review of MdfA see Lewinson et al., 2006. The conformational switch accompanying transport is induced by the promiscuous binding of substrates and\/or inhibitors to the binding pocket (Fluman et al., 2009). MdfA normally extrudes monovalent cationic drugs in exchange for a single proton, but it transports divalent cationic drugs poorly. It can be mutated to antiport a divalent cationic drug for 2 protons (Tirosh et al., 2012). Transporters acting across the inner and outer membranes have synergistic effects with each other, but transporters acting across the same membrane are usually additive but can be synergistic under special circumstances, owing to a bifurcation controlled by the barrier constant (Saha et al. 2020). Promiscuity in the geometry of electrostatic interactions between MdfA and cationic substrates has been demonstrated (Adler and Bibi 2005). With respect to ethidium bromide, the inner membrane transporter MdfA is synergistic to the TolC-dependent efflux across the outer membrane (Saha et al. 2020).

Mahrhold et al. 2006 showed that BoNT\/A also interacts with a synaptic vesicle protein, the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C), but not with the homologous proteins SV2A and SV2B. Binding of BoNT\/A occurs at the membrane juxtaposed region preceding transmembrane domain 8. A peptide comprising the intravesicular domain between transmembrane domains 7 and 8 specifically reduces the neurotoxicity of BoNT\/A at phrenic nerve preparations, demonstrating the physiological relevance of this interaction (Mahrhold et al. 2006). The interactions of SV2C with BoNT have been reviewed (Li et al. 2020). SV2C is implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Stout et al. 2019).

Single point mutations allow transport of sucrose and maltose (King and Wilson 1990). Crystal structures and modeling reveal the cytoplasmic open state and the periplasmic open state (PDB ID: 1PV7). A structure with a bound lactose homolog, beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, revealed the sugar-binding site in a cavity, and residues that play major roles in substrate recognition and proton translocation were identified (Abramson\u00a0et al., 2003;\u00a0Pendse\u00a0et al., 2010). The membrane lipid composition determines the topology of LacY (Dowhan and Bogdanov, 2011). Smirnova et al. (2011) have provided evidence that the opening of the periplasmic cavity in LacY is the limiting step for sugar binding. Evidence for an alternating sites mechanism of transport has been summarized (Smirnova\u00a0et al., 2011). Eames and Kortemme (2012) have shown that when considering expression of the\u00a0lac\u00a0operon, LacY function (H+ co-transport) and not protein production is the primary origin of cost fitness. Homology threading of several MFS porters based on the LacY 3-d structure has been reported (Kasho\u00a0et al., 2006). The alternating-access mechanism has been suggested to arise from inverted topological repeats (Radestock and Forrest, 2011;\u00a0Madej\u00a0et al.\u00a02012), but this proposal has been contested (V\u00e4stermark and Saier 2014;\u00a0V\u00e4stermark\u00a0et al.\u00a02014). Mechanistic features of LacY have been summarized (Kaback 2015). Insertion into the membrane depends on YidC (TC# 2.A.9.3.1) and may occur in a stepwise, stochastic manner employing multiple coexisting pathways to complete the folding process (Serdiuk et al. 2017). The glucose Enzyme IIA (Crr) protein binds LacY to allosterically inhibit its activity, promoting inducer exclusion (Hoischen et al. 1996; Hariharan et al. 2015). Protonated LacY binds D-galactopyranosides specifically, inducing an occluded state that can open to either side of the membrane (Kumar et al. 2014). LacY can form amyloid-like fibrils under destabilizing conditions (Stroobants et al. 2017). Multiple conformations of LacY have been solved (Kumar et al. 2018). Direct interactions between LacY and its lipid environment uniquely contribute to its membrane protein organization and function (Vitrac et al. 2020).

ProP detects the increase in cytoplasmic cation concentration associated with osmotically induced cell dehydration and mediates osmolyte uptake into bacteria (Ozturk et al. 2020). ProP is a 12-TMS protein with an \u03b1-helical, cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD) linked to TMS XII. The CTD helix associates with the anionic membrane surface to lock ProP in an inactive conformation. The release of the CTD may activate ProP.

Regulatory crosstalk in the trimeric BetP has been reported (G\u00e4rtner et al., 2011). An extracellular K+ -dependent interaction site modulates betaine-binding (Ge et al., 2011). The porter is trimeric and exhibits structural asymmetry (Tsai et al., 2011). The C-terminal domain is involved in osmosensing and is trimeric like wild-type BetP. The two Na+ binding sites are between TMSs 1 and 8 in the first and second 5 TMS repeats, and between the equivalent TMSs 6 and 3 in the second and first repeats, respectively (Khafizov et al. 2012). interdependent binding of betaine and two sodium ions is observed during the coupling process. All three sites undergo progressive reshaping and dehydration during the alternating-access cycle, with the most optimal coordination of all substrates found in the closed state (Perez et al. 2014). BetP is active and regulated only when negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidyl glycerol are present, and the mechanism has been discussed (G\u00fcler et al. 2016).

The rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is  a master growth regulator that responds to multiple environmental cues.  Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar ATPase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb.\u00a0Wang et al. 2015 showed that lysosomal SLC38A9 interacts with Rag GTPases and Ragulator  in an amino acid-sensitive fashion. SLC38A9 transports arginine, and loss of SLC38A9 represses mTORC1 activation  by amino acids, particularly arginine. Overexpression of SLC38A9 or just its Ragulator-binding domain makes mTORC1 signaling insensitive to amino acid starvation but not to Rag activity. Thus, SLC38A9 functions upstream of the Rag GTPases and is probably the arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. Jung et al. 2015 confirmed SLC38A9 to be a Rag-Ragulator complex member, transducing amino acid availability to mTORC1. Lysosomal cholesterol activates TORC1 via an SLC38A9-Niemann-Pick C1 signaling complex (Castellano et al. 2017). The Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein (TC# 2.A.6.6.1), which regulates cholesterol export from the lysosome, binds to SLC38A9 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling through its sterol transport function (Castellano et al. 2017). Ragulator and SLC38A9 are each unique guanine exchange factors (GEFs) that collectively push the Rag GTPases toward the active state (Shen and Sabatini 2018). Ragulator triggers GTP release from RagC, thus resolving the locked inactivated state of the Rag GTPases. Upon arginine binding, SLC38A9 converts RagA from the GDP- to the GTP-loaded state, and therefore activates the Rag GTPase heterodimer. Thus, Ragulator and SLC38A9 act on the Rag GTPases to activate the mTORC1 pathway in response to nutrient sufficiency.","2":"PBDID: 6WJ2  PBDID: 6WJ3"},{"0":"2.A.18.9.2","1":"SLC38A9 of 549 aas and 111 TMSs.

The 3 D structure is known ()PDB 5I6X), and it uses an alternating sites mechanism with all 3 substrates bound (Zhang and Rudnick, 2006). Molecular determinants for antidepressants in the human serotonin and norepinephrine A transporters have been identified (Andersen et al., 2011). A conserved asparagine residue in transmembrane segment 1 (TMS1) of the serotonin transporter dictates chloride-coupled neurotransmitter transport (Henry et al., 2011). The formation and breakage of ionic interactions with amino acids in transmembrane helices 6 and 8 and intracellular loop 1 may be of importance for substrate translocation (Gabrielsen et al., 2012). Methylation of the SLC6A4 gene promoter controls depression in men by an epigenetic mechanism (Devlin et al., 2010). The 5HT Km is 0.4 micromolar (Banovic et al. 2010). Regulated allosterically by ATM7 which stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of SERT (Kortagere et al. 2013). Functional and regulatory mechanisms involving the N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains have been considered (Fenollar-Ferrer et al. 2014). The range of substrates bound and transported has been predicted (Kaufmann et al. 2009). TMS3 may function in substrate and antagonist recognition (Walline et al. 2008). The 3-d x-ray structures with antidepressants bound have been solved, leading to mechanistic predictions; antidepressants lock SERT in an outward-open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between TMSs 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding (Coleman et al. 2016). Na+ and cocaine stabilize outward-open conformations of SERT and decrease phosphorylation while agents that stabilize inward-open conformations (e.g., 5-HT, ibogaine) increase phosphorylation. The opposing effects of the inhibitors, cocaine and ibogaine, were each reversed by an excess of the other inhibitor. Inhibition of phosphorylation by Na+ and stimulation by ibogaine occurred at concentrations that induced outward opening and inward opening, respectively (Zhang et al. 2016). SERT is regulated by multiple molecular mechanisms including its physical interaction with intracellular proteins including the ASCT2 (alanine-serine-cysteine-threonine 2; TC# 2.A.23.3.2), co-expressed with SERT in serotonergic neurons and involved in the transport of small neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane (Seyer et al. 2016). SERT transports substituted amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) (Sealover et al. 2016). A naturally occurring mutation, I425V, associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder and other neuropsychiatric disorders, activates hSERT and eliminates stimulation via the cyclicGMP-dependent pathway (Zhang et al. 2007). The substituted amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), is a widely used drug of abuse that induces non-exocytotic release of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine through their cognate  transporters as well as blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitter by the same transporters. In SERT, Glu394 plays a role in MDMA recognition (Sealover et al. 2016). Intestinal dysbiosis may upregulate SERT expression and contribute to the development of chronic constipation (Cao et al. 2017). Cryo-EM structures of SERT-ibogaine complexes captured in outward-open, occluded and inward-open conformations have been solved (Coleman et al. 2019). Ibogaine binds to the central binding site, and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMSs 1b and 6a. Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hinge-like movement of TMS 1a and the partial unwinding of TMS 5, which together create a permeation pathway that enables substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm, thus defining the structural rearrangements that occur from the outward-open to inward-open conformations. SERT and cholecytokinin (CCK) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of Irrritable Bowl Syndrome (IBS-D) by regulating the brain-gut axis and affecting visceral sensitivity (Qin et al. 2020). Altered SERT function leads to several neurological diseases including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) (Sz\u00f6ll\u00c5\u0091si and Stockner 2021). The structure and dynamics of the two sodium binding sites indicate that sodium binding is accompanied by an induced-fit mechanism that leads to new conformations (Sz\u00f6ll\u00c5\u0091si and Stockner 2021). Occlusion of the serotonin transporter is mediated by serotonin-induced conformational changes in the bundle domain (Gradisch et al. 2022). A structural rearrangement of the SERT intracellular gate is induced by Thr276 phosphorylation (Chan et al. 2022). Na+\/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters form oligomers. A leucine heptad repeat in TMS2 and a glycophorin-like motif in TMS6 may stabilize the oligomer (Just et al. 2004). Oligomerization of hSERT involves at least two discontinuous interfaces to form an array-like structure containing multimers of dimers (Just et al. 2004). .","2":"PBDID: 5i6x  PBDID: 5i6z  PBDID: 5I71  PBDID: 5I73  PBDID: 5I74  PBDID: 5I75  PBDID: 6AWN  PBDID: 6AWO  PBDID: 6AWP  PBDID: 6AWQ  PBDID: 6DZV  PBDID: 6DZW  PBDID: 6DZY  PBDID: 6DZZ  PBDID: 6VRH  PBDID: 6VRK  PBDID: 6VRL  PBDID: 6W2B  PBDID: 6W2C"},{"0":"2.A.22.1.7","1":"Dopamine transporter.

LeuT possesses two ion binding sites, NA1 and NA2, both highly specific for Na+ but with differing mechanisms of binding (Noskov and Roux, 2008). X-ray structures have been determined for LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states (Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012). Extracytoplasmic substrate binding at an allosteric site controls activity (Zhao et al. 2011). It has been proposed that the 5 TMS repeat derived from a DedA domain (9.B.27; Khafizov et al. 2010). Mechanistic aspect of Na+ binding have been studied (Perez and Ziegler 2013). Structural studies of mutant LeuT proteins suggest how antidepressants bind to biogenic amine transporters (Wang et al. 2013). The detailed mechanism was studied by Zhao and Noskov, 2013. Uptake involves movement of the substrate amino acid from the outward facing binding site, S1, to the inward facing binding site, S2, coupled with confrmational changes in the protein (Cheng and Bahar 2013). The complete substrate translocation pathway has been proposed (Cheng and Bahar 2014). The inward facing conformation of LeuT has been solved (Grouleff et al. 2015). Substrate-induced unlocking of the inner gatemay determinethe catalytic efficiency of the transporter (Billesb\u00f8lle et al. 2015). Of the two Na+ binding sites, occupation of Na2 stabilizes outward-facing conformations presumably through a direct interaction between Na+ and transmembrane helices 1 and 8 whereas Na+ binding at Na1 influences conformational change through a network of intermediary interactions (Tavoulari et al. 2015). TMS1A movements revealed a substantially different inward-open conformation in lipid bilayer from that inferred from the crystal structure, especiallly with respect to the inner vestibule (Sohail et al. 2016). Partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1, 5, 6 and7 drives LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation toward an inward-facing open state (Merkle et al. 2018). A conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site is required for substrate binding to convert LeuT to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains (Zhang et al. 2018). The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has revealed the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020). This involves a major tilting of the cytoplasmic end of TMS5, which, together with release of the N-terminus but without coupled movement of TM1) opens a wide cavity towards the second Na+ binding site. The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has been solved, revealing the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 2A65  PBDID: 2Q6H  PBDID: 2Q72  PBDID: 2QB4  PBDID: 2QEI  PBDID: 2QJU  PBDID: 3F3A  PBDID: 3F3C  PBDID: 3F3D  PBDID: 3F3E  PBDID: 3F48  PBDID: 3F4I  PBDID: 3F4J  PBDID: 3GJC  PBDID: 3GJD  PBDID: 3GWU  PBDID: 3GWV  PBDID: 3GWW  PBDID: 3MPN  PBDID: 3MPQ  PBDID: 3QS4  PBDID: 3QS5  PBDID: 3QS6  PBDID: 3TT1  PBDID: 3TT3  PBDID: 3TU0  PBDID: 3USG  PBDID: 3USI  PBDID: 3USJ  PBDID: 3USK  PBDID: 3USL  PBDID: 3USM  PBDID: 3USO  PBDID: 3USP  PBDID: 4FXZ  PBDID: 4FY0  PBDID: 4HMK  PBDID: 4HOD  PBDID: 4MM4  PBDID: 4MM5  PBDID: 4MM6  PBDID: 4MM7  PBDID: 4MM8  PBDID: 4MM9  PBDID: 4MMA  PBDID: 4MMB  PBDID: 4MMC  PBDID: 4MMD  PBDID: 4MME  PBDID: 4MMF  PBDID: 5JAE  PBDID: 5JAF  PBDID: 5JAG  PBDID: 6NLE  PBDID: 6XWM"},{"0":"2.A.22.5.3","1":"Neurotransmitter:sodium symporter of 455 aas, MhsT.

These structures provide insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+.  The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na+2 site. Solvation through this TMS 5 pathway may facilitate Na+ release from the Na+2 site to the inward-open state (Malinauskaite et al. 2014). TMS5 plays a role in the binding and release of Na+ from the Na+2 site and in mediating conformational changes (Stolzenberg et al. 2017). MhsT of Bacillus halodurans is a transporter of hydrophobic amino acids and a homologue of the eukaryotic SLC6 family of Na+ -dependent symporters for amino acids, neurotransmitters, osmolytes, and creatine.

Uptake of leucine is sodium-dependent. In contrast to other members of the neurotransmitter transporter family, this one does not appear to be chloride-dependent. Activity is enhanced by collectrin (Tmem27), a collecting duct transmembrane (1 TMS) glycoprotein (Q9HBJ8) (Danilczyk et al., 2006). The mouse orthologue is (Q9D687) (Broer et al., 2004; 2008) which is deficient due to mutation(s) in its structural gene, and it forms a complex with collectrin and the brush border carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Q9BYF1). Mutations in Hartnup disorder protein, such as B0AT1(R240Q), decrease complex formation (Kraut and Sachs 2005) and lead to neutral aminoaciduria and in some cases pellagra-like symptoms (Kowalczuk et al., 2008; Singer et al. 2012). Collectrin is expressed at high levels in the simple embryonic kidney (the pronephros) of amphibians such as Xenopus (McCoy et al. 2008). ACE2 plays an important role in amino acid transport by  acting as a binding partner of SLC6A19 in the intestine, regulating its trafficking, expression on the cell surface and catalytic activity (Kowalczuk et al. 2008, Camargo et al. 2009).

Gltph shows opposite movement of the external gate upon binding cotransported sodium compared with substrate (Focke et al., 2011). The transport pathway and the conformational changes involved have been suggested based on modeling studies (Stolzenberg et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2018). Individual transport domains may alternate between periods of quiescence and periods of rapid transitions. The switch to the dynamic mode may be due to separation of the transport domain from the trimeric scaffold which precedes domain movements across the bilayer (Akyuz et al. 2013). This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain is approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be rate determining in the transport cycle.

Mice have three ANTs, and if all three are knocked out, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) can not form, although with only two eliminated, it still can, suggesting the an ANT is an essential constituent of the MPTP (Karch et al. 2019). The MPT provides a mechanism of skeletal muscle atrophy that operates through mROS emission and caspase-3 activation (Burke et al. 2021). Inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A aggravates fatty liver graft injury by promoting the mitochondrial permeability transition (Xue et al. 2021). Upon protein kinase C (PKC) inactivation, the cytoprotective compound, bisindolylpyrrole, can induce prolonged transient MPTP, causing apoptosis in a cyclophilin D (CypD)-dependent manner through the VDAC1\/2-regulated ANT-associated pore (Koushi et al. 2020). ANT1 mediates H+ transport, but only in the presence of long-chain fatty acids (FA), as already known for UCPs. It depends on FA chain length and saturation, implying that FA transport is confined to the lipid-protein interface. Purine nucleotides with the preference for ATP and ADP inhibited H+ transport, as do inhibitors of ATP\/ADP transport, carboxyatractyloside and bongkrekic acid (Kreiter et al. 2021).

UCP2 transports protons and chloride ions, is activated by fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleotides (Hoang et al. 2012). It reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in response to intracellular Ca2+ release in pancreatic beta cells (Alam et al. 2012). Arginine residues in TMS2 are important for chloride transport without affecting fatty acid-dependent proton transport (Hoang et al. 2015). UCP2 is impermeable to water and has a fatty acid binding site related to H+ transport (\u0160kulj et al. 2021).

Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of xCT that is known to increase cellular oxidative stress, giving it anti-tumor potential, but it seems to have many side effects (Nagane et al. 2018). xCT is a cancer stem cell-related target and can be used to develop preclinical therapeutic approaches, able to hamper tumor growth and dissemination (Ruiu et al. 2019).

The two subunits, a heavy chain and a light chain are linked by a disulfide bridge. The light chain forms a heterodimer with rBAT, a heavy chain which mediates the membrane trafficking of b(0,+)AT. The b(0,+)AT-rBAT complex is an obligatory exchanger, which mediates the influx of cystine and cationic amino acids and the efflux of neutral amino acids in the kidney and small intestine. Yan et al. 2020 reported the cryo-EM structure of the human b(0,+)AT-rBAT complex alone and in complex with an arginine substrate at resolutions of 2.7 and 2.3 \u00c5, respectively.

The heavy chain, CD98hc, modulates integrin signaling, plays a role in cell-to-cell fusion, and is essential for Brucella infection (Keriel et al. 2015). In addition to several large neutral L-amino acids, Lat1 in conjunction with 4F2hc, transports S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Li and Whorton 2007), is important for transport of certain drugs into the brain, and is important for cancer (Lee et al. 2019). LAT1\/CD98 mediates a Na+ and pH-independent antiport of amino  acids (Scalise et al. 2018). It has been demonstrated that the preferred substrate is histidine, but many large amino acids are also sustrates. CD98 is not required for transport, being plausibly involved in routing LAT1 to the plasma membrane. Homology models  have been built on the basis of the AdiC transporter from E.coli.  Crucial residues for substrate recognition and gating have been identified using a combined approach of bioinformatics and site-directed  mutagenesis coupled to functional assays. LAT1 is involved in important human diseases such as neurological disorders and cancer (Scalise et al. 2018). The cryo-EM structure of the human LAT1-CD98hc heterodimer at 3.3-A resolution has been determined (Lee et al. 2019). LAT1 features a canonical Leu T-fold and exhibits an unusual loop structure on transmembrane helix 6, creating an extended cavity that might accommodate bulky amino acids and drugs. CD98hc engages with LAT1 through extracellular, transmembrane and putative cholesterol-mediated interactions. The SLC7A5 (LAT1) gene, which encodes the main transmembrane transporter of large neutral amino acids and of thyroid hormones, exists as variants, one of which is responsible for obesity in patients with phenylketonuria (Bik-Multanowski et al. 2020). SLC7A5 functions in mTORC1 ativation in late endosomes (Jin et al. 2021). It is the main transporter for phenylalanine, and management precautions for risk of obesity are necessary among infants with PKU carrying the rs113883650 variant of the LAT1 gene (Bik-Multanowski et al. 2022). CD98hc is expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in increased amounts (Bianconi et al. 2022). Human LAT1 (SLC7A5) transports amino acids, thyroid hormones, and drugs such as the Parkinson's disease drug levodopa (L-Dopa). It is found in the blood-brain barrier, testis, bone marrow, and placenta, and its dysregulation has been associated with various neurological diseases, such as autism and epilepsy, as well as cancer (Hutchinson et al. 2022).

Isoform 4 has no transport activity. The kinase, WNK3, activates NKCC1\/2 and NCC but inhibits the KCCs (Cruz-Rangel et al. 2011). Liu et al. 2019 presented cryo-EM structures of human KCC1 in potassium chloride or sodium chloride at 2.9- to 3.5-\u00c5 resolution. KCC1 exists as a dimer, with both extracellular and transmembrane domains involved in dimerization. The structural and functional analyses, along with computational studies, reveal one potassium site and two chloride sites in KCC1, which are all required for the ion transport activity. The structure reveals an inward-facing conformation, with the extracellular gate occluded. The KCC1 structures allowed the authors to model a potential ion transport mechanism in KCCs and provide a blueprint for drug design (Liu et al. 2019). KCC1 bound with the VU0463271 inhibitor in an outward-open state has been solved (Zhao et al. 2022). In contrast to many other amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporter cousins, opening the KCC1 extracellular ion permeation path does not involve hinge-bending motions of TMS 1 and TMS6 half-helices. Instead, rocking of TMS3 and TMS8, together with displacements of TMS4, TMS9, and a conserved intracellular loop 1 helix, underlie alternate opening and closing of extracellular and cytoplasmic vestibules.

Loop diuretic and ion binding residues have been identified (Somasekharan et al., 2012). NKCC1 is important for regulating cell volume, hearing, blood pressure, and hyperpolarizing GABAergic and glycinergic signaling in the central nervous system. NKCC1 is the major Cl--loader responsible for the depolarizing action of GABA\/glycine receptors at postnatal days 3-5 in cochlear nucleus neurons (Witte et al. 2014). Its activity is stimulated by ammonia (Hertz et al. 2015). NKCC maintains Cl- gradients to sustain pacemaker activity (TC# 1.A.1.5.10) in interstitial cells of Cajal (Zhu et al. 2016). It uses the existing Na+ and\/or K+ gradients to move Cl- into or out of cells. NKCC1 plays fundamental roles in regulating trans-epithelial ion movement, cell volume, chloride homeostasis and neuronal excitability. Yang et al. 2020 reported a cryo-EM structure of human NKCC1 captured in a partially loaded, inward-open state. NKCC1 assembles into a dimer, with the first ten TMSs harboring the transport core and TM11-TM12 helices lining the dimer interface. TMSs 1 and 6 break alpha-helical geometry halfway across the lipid bilayer where ion binding sites are organized around these discontinuous regions. NKCC1 may harbor multiple extracellular entryways and intracellular exit sites, raising the possibility that K+, Na+, and Cl- ions may traverse along their own routes for translocation (Yang et al. 2020). It is present in the basolateral membrane of crypt epithelial cells and mediates uptake of these three ions into these cells (A. Quach, personal communication). NKCC1 mediates trans-epithelial Cl- secretion and regulates excitability of some neurons, while NKCC2 is critical to renal salt reabsorption. Bumetanide is a mainstay for treating edema and hypertension. Cryo-EM structures reveal an outward-facing conformation of NKCC1, showing bumetanide wedged into a pocket in the extracellular ion translocation pathway. Zhao et al. 2022 defined the translocation pathway and the conformational changes necessary for ion translocation. An NKCC1 dimer was observed with separated transmembrane domains and extensive transmembrane and C-terminal domain interactions. An N-terminal phosphoregulatory domain that interacts with the C-terminal domain, suggests a mechanism whereby (de)phosphorylation regulates NKCC1 by tuning the strength of this domain association (Zhao et al. 2022). The cryo-EM structure of the human NKCC1 transporter revealed the mechanisms of ion coupling and specificity (Neumann et al. 2022). In human tissue, NKCC1 plays a critical role in regulating cytoplasmic volume, fluid intake, chloride homeostasis, and cell polarity. Moseng et al. 2022 reported four structures of human NKCC1, both in the absence and presence of loop diuretic (bumetanide or furosemide), using single-particle cryoEM. These structures reveal various novel conformations of the hNKCC1 dimer. They also reveal two drug-binding sites located at the transmembrane and cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domains, respectively. This allows delineation of an inhibition mechanism that involves a coupled movement between the cytosolic and transmembrane domains of hNKCC1 (Moseng et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 6PZT"},{"0":"2.A.31.1.1","1":"Anion exchanger (AE, HCO3-:Cl- antiporter; also called Band 3 or CDB3; SLC4a1, Q9BWU0) transports a variety of inorganic and organic anions.

Mutations cause Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) hereditary spherocytosis and distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) with impaired acid secretion in humans (Chu et al., 2010; Kittanakom et al., 2008; Toye et al., 2008). It is activated by glycophorin A (Stewart et al., 2011). Glycophorin has been reported to interact with kidney AE1 (Chen et al. 1998), but Kittanakom et al. 2005 could not detect this interaction. H\u00fcbner et al. 2002, 2003 reported nuclear and mitochondrial targetting of kanadaptin. Some point mutations in AE allow the normally electroneutral anion exchanger to catalyze Na+ and K+ conductance or induce a cation leak in the still functional anion exchanger. A structural model of the AE1 membrane spanning domain, based on the structure of the uracil-proton symporter, suggests that there is a unique transport site comprising TMSs 3-5 and 8 that may function in anion exchange and cation leak (Barneaud-Rocca et al. 2013). The spectrin-actin-based cytoskeletal network is attached to the plasma membrane through interactions with ankyrin, which binds to both spectrin and a beta-hairpin loop in the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (Stefanovic et al. 2007). A detailed transport mechanism has been proposed. It involves an elevator-like motion of the substrate-binding domain relative to the nearly stationary dimerization domain and to the membrane plane (Ficici et al. 2017). The structure-function relationships of band 3 have been reviewed (Abbas et al. 2018). Interaction of the human erythrocyte Band 3 with lipids and glycophorin A have revealed the molecular organization of the Wright (Wr) blood group antigen (Kalli and Reithmeier 2018). Some inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase in the 0.22-2.8 microM range also inhibit anion exchage catalyzed by AE1 (Morgan et al. 2015). The molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of HCO3- permeation through anion channels has been reviewed (Shin et al. 2020). Nifedipine is both an activator (fast) and de-activator (slow) of CDB3 (Yastrebova et al. 2019). The substrate anion selectivity filter may be in the V849 to L863 region of the protein (Zhu and Casey 2004). R730 in hAE1 is crucial for anion binding to both the entry and central sites, while in hNBCe1 (TC# 2.A.31.2.12), a Na+ acts as an anchor for CO32- binding to the central site. Protonation of the central acidic residues (E681 in hAE1 and D754 in hNBCe1) alters the ion dynamics in the permeation cavity and may contribute to the transport mode differences in SLC4 proteins (Zhekova et al. 2021). The past 150 years of research on AE have been reviewed (Jennings 2021). A missense mutation in AE1 causes autosomal dominant distal renal tubular acidosis although the transporter retains normal transport function (Rungroj et al. 2004). It is mistargeted in polarized epithelial cells. Band3-mediated anion transport is reduced upon HgCl2 treatment (Notariale et al. 2022). AE1 (Slc4A1) transports CO3-- (Lee et al. 2022). AE1 is the main erythroid Cl-\/HCO3- transporter that supports CO2 transport. Glycophorin A (GPA), a component of the AE1 complexes, facilitates AE1 expression and anion transport, but Glycophorin B (GPB) does not (Hsu et al. 2022).

NBCe1, together with carbonic anhydrase II, CAII, provides an efficient mechanism of bicarbonate sensing in cortical astrocytes (Theparambil et al. 2017). NBCe1-B is widely expressed in many tissues, including the pancreas, submandibular gland, brain, heart, etc. It has very low activity under basal conditions due to auto-inhibition, but can be fully activated by interaction with IRBIT (TC# 8.A.151.1.1). IRBIT activates NBCe1-B by releasing the auto-inhibition module from the transmembrane domain (Su et al. 2020).

Stoichiometry = 1:1. TMS VI of NHE1 is a discontinuous pore-lining helix with residues Asn(227), Ile(233), and Leu(243) lining the translocation pore (Tzeng et al., 2010). (orthologous to NHE1 of rat, TC# 2.A.36.1.1). Both Pro167 and Pro168 in TMS IV are required for normal NHE activity (Slepkov et al. 2004). NHE1 regulates internal pH in human monocytes and is important in heart disease and cancer (Tsai et al. 2015). Structural studies have been performed using NMR and EPR (Lee et al., 2011; Nygaard et al. 2011). Extracytoplasmic loops contribute to ion coordination and inhibitor sensitivity (Lee et al. 2012). The regulation of NHE1 has been reviewed (Wakabayashi et al. 2013). CD44 (LHR, MDU2, MDU3, MIC4; P16070; TC# 9.B.87.1.31) regulates breast cancer metastasis by regulating NHE1 expression (Chang et al. 2014). The role of NHE1 in kidney proximal tubule functions, including pH regulation, vectorial Na+ transport, cell volume control and cell survival has been reviewed (Parker et al. 2015). Helix M9 and the adjacent exofacial re-entrant loop 5 between M9 and M10 (EL5) are important elements involved in cation transport and inhibitor sensitivity (Jinadasa et al. 2015). A 12 TMS topology has been confirmed (Liu et al. 2015). Mutations cause Lichtenstein-Knorr syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition that associates sensorineural hearing loss with cerebellar ataxia (Guissart et al. 2015). Cleaved FAS ligand (transmembrane CD95L; 1 TMS; P48023) activates NHE1 through the Akt\/ROCK1 signalling pathway to stimulate cell motility (Monet et al. 2016). NHE1 may contribute to internal pH and motility of mammalian sperm (Muzzachi et al. 2018). NHE1 appears to be the only significant regulator of intracellular pH in preimplantation mouse embryos (Siyanov and Baltz 2013). The intracellular loop, IL5, is critical for proton sensing and ion transport (Wong et al. 2018). NHE1 and CD44 (the hyaluronan receptor with 742 aas and 2 TMSs, one at the N-terminus and one at the C-terminus (P16070)) appear to play important roles in cardiac remodeling (Suleiman et al. 2018). A three-dimensional model of NHE1, accounting for inhibitor binding, has been proposed (Dutta and Fliegel 2019). It forms a complex with Kv11.1 (TC# 1.A.1.20.1) and \u03b2-integrin (TC# 9.B.87.1.25). Activation of Na+\/H+ exchanger isoform 1 is regulated by the extracellular environment and protein cofactors, including calcineurin B homologous proteins 1 and 2 (Cottle et al. 2020). NHE1, a central regulator of transmembrane pH that supports carcinogenic progression, is inhibited by 5- and 6-substituted amilorides (Buckley et al. 2021). The roles of NHE1 in health and disease have been reviewed (Fliegel 2021).

An inherited R325W mutant gives aberant zinc transport in pancreatic beta cells (Weijers 2010). It is chiefly expressed in pancreatic islet cells, where it mediates zinc (Zn2+) uptake into secretory granules. It plays a role in glucose tolerance (Mitchell et al. 2016). ZnT8 is one of four human vesicular zinc transporters. It supplies millimolar zinc concentrations to insulin granules in pancreatic beta-cells, affecting insulin processing, crystallisation, and secretion. ZnT8 has a transmembrane and a C-terminal cytosolic domain; the latter has important functions and purportedly mediates protein-protein interactions, senses cytosolic zinc, and channels zinc to the transport site in the transmembrane domain (Parsons et al. 2018). The variant, W325R, in the C-terminal domain (CTD) increases the risk to develop type 2 diabetes and affects autoantibody specificity in type 1 diabetes. The CTDs of the WT and mutant proteins form tetramers which are stabilized by zinc binding and exhibit negligible differences in their secondary structural content and zinc-binding affinities in solution (Ullah et al. 2020). Xue et al. 2020 described cryo-EM structures in both outward- and inward-facing conformations. HsZnT8 forms a dimeric structure with four Zn2+ binding sites within each subunit with a highly conserved primary site in the TMD housing the Zn2+ substrate. An interfacial site between the TMD and the CTD modulates the Zn2+ transport activity. Two adjacent sites buried in the cytosolic domain are chelated by conserved residues from CTD and the His-Cys-His (HCH) motif from the N-terminal segment of the neighboring subunit. A comparison of the outward- and inward-facing structures reveals that the TMD of each subunit undergoes a large structural rearrangement, allowing for alternating access to the primary Zn2+ site during the transport cycle (Xue et al. 2020). The C-terminal domain of the human zinc transporter hZnT8 Is structurally indistinguishable from its disease risk variant (R325W) (Ullah et al. 2020). The dynamics of ZnT8 have been studied (Sala et al. 2021), revealing that packing of the TMSs affects channel accessibility from the cytosol. The dimer interface that keeps the two TM channels in contact became looser in both variants upon zinc binding to the transport site, suggesting that this may be an important step toward the switch from the inward- to the outward-facing states of the protein (Sala et al. 2021). The C-terminal cysteines, which are part of the cytosolic domain, are involved in a metal chelation and\/or acquisition mechanism, and provides the first example of metal-thiolate coordination chemistry in zinc transporters (Catapano et al. 2021).

A 6 TMS bundle features of a tetrahedral Zn2+ binding site (Lu and Fu, 2007). The gated water access to the transport site enables a stationary proton gradient to facilitate the conversion of zinc-binding energy to the kinetic power stroke of a vectorial zinc transport (Gupta et al. 2014). Of the two cavities of the dimer, only one was accessible from the cytosol during transport. Zinc(II) binding to D49 of the transport site triggered a rearrangement of the TMS that closed the accessible cavity. The free-energy profiles of metal transit in the channel suggested the existence of a high barrier preventing release from the transport site (Sala et al. 2019).

Full-length variants of CzrB in the apo and zinc-loaded states were generated by homology modeling with the Zn2+\/H+ antiporter YiiP. The model suggests a way in which zinc  binding to the cytoplasmic fragment creates a docking site to which a metallochaperone can bind for delivery and transport of zinc. A proposal was advanced that it functions as a metallochaperone and regulates the zinc-transporting activity of  the full-length protein.

Functionaly critical residues in transmembrane segments 1 and 3 have been identified (Amillis et al., 2011). The substrate recognition and transport pathway have been proposed (Kosti et al., 2012; Kosti et al. 2010). UapA oligomerization is essential for membrane trafficking and turnover and is a common theme in fungi and mammalian cells (Martzoukou et al. 2015). Specificity is determined by the interactions of a given substrate with the TMS8-9 loop and by interactions of this loop with TMS1 and TMS12 (Papageorgiou et al. 2008). F528 and Q408 in TMS 12 are important for substrate recognition, and mutation of the former results in high efficiency uptake of several purines and pyrimidines not otherwise transported (Vlanti et al. 2006). A high resolution structure of UapA is available, and it is formed from two domains, a core domain and a gate domain, similar to the previously solved uracil transporter UraA, which belongs to the same family (Alguel et al. 2016). The structure shows UapA in an inward-facing conformation with xanthine bound to residues in the  core domain. Unlike UraA, which is a monomer, UapA forms a dimer in the crystals with dimer interactions formed exclusively through the gate domain. Analysis of dominant negative mutants is consistent with dimerization playing a key role in transport. Alguel et al. 2016 postulated that UapA uses an elevator transport mechanism likely to be shared with other structurally homologous transporters including anion exchangers and prestin. Specific residues in UapA are critical for dimerization, ER-exit and function (Kourkoulou et al. 2019). Despite structural and functional differences, all elevator-type transporters use a common mechanism of substrate translocation via reversible movements of a mobile core domain (the elevator) hosting the substrate binding site along a rigid scaffold domain stably anchored in the plasma membrane via homodimerization (Dimakis et al. 2022). One of the best studied elevator transporters is the UapA uric acid-xanthine\/H+ symporter of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. TMSs 5 and 12 in UapA control, negatively or positively, the dynamics of transport as well as substrate binding affinity and specificity. Mutations in TMS5 can lead to increased rate of transport, but also to an inactive transporter due to high-affinity substrate-trapping, whereas mutations in TMS12 lead to apparently uncontrolled sliding and broadened specificity, leading in specific cases to UapA-mediated purine toxicity.","2":"PBDID: 5i6c"},{"0":"2.A.41.2.11","1":"Concentrative nucleoside transporter, CNT, of 418 aas and 12 TMSs.

The exchange mechanism involves a conformational cycle of alternating exposure of Cl- and H+ binding sites of both ClC pores to the two sides of the membrane (Miloshevsky et al., 2010). Specific aspects of these conformational changes have been proposed (Wang et al. 2018).

The structures revealed how HHAT overcomes the challenges of bringing together substrates that have different physiochemical properties from opposite sides of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane within a membrane-embedded active site for catalysis (Jiang et al. 2021). The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) morphogen pathway is fundamental for embryonic development and stem cell maintenance and is implicated in various cancers. A key step in signaling is transfer of a palmitate group to the SHH N terminus, catalyzed by HHAT.\u00a0Coupland et al. 2021 presented a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of HHAT bound to substrate analog palmityl-coenzyme A and a SHH-mimetic megabody, revealing a heme group bound to HHAT that is essential for HHAT function.

The analysis provided a detailed view of the mechanism by which HHAT adapts the membrane environment to transfer an acyl chain across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

Wang et al. 2020 addressed how human DGAT1 and other mammalian members of the MBOAT family recognize their substrates and catalyse their reactions.

Each DGAT1 protomer has nine transmembrane helices, eight of which form a conserved structural fold, the MBOAT fold. It forms a hollow chamber in the membrane that encloses highly conserved catalytic residues. The chamber has separate entrances for each of the two substrates, fatty acyl-CoA and diacylglycerol. DGAT1 exists as either a homodimer or a homotetramer, and the two forms have similar enzymatic activities. The N terminus of DGAT1 interacts with the neighbouring protomer, and these interactions are required for enzymatic activity (Wang et al. 2020). In liver it plays a role in esterifying exogenous fatty acids to glycerol and is the major acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase in the skin, where it acts to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent retinoid toxicity, leading to skin and hair disorders.

A 12 TMS topology with intracellular N- and C-termini is established. Two-fold structural symmetry in the arrangement of membrane helices for TMSs 1-5 and TMSs 6-10 (conserved Slc11 hydrophobic core) is suggested (Czachorowski et al., 2009). A conserved motif in a central flexible region of TMS1 (DPGN) binds the metal ion (Wang et al. 2011). It is upregulated by iron deficiency and downregulated by iron loading (Nam et al. 2013). NRAMP2 also serves as the Sindbis alpha virus receptor (Rose et al. 2011). DMT1 interacts with the iron chaparone protein, PCBP2 (Q15366), in an iron-dependent fashion, and may be essential for iron uptake (Lane and Richardson 2014). Mutations cause a syndrome of congenital microcytic hypochromic anemia, poorly responsive to oral iron treatment, with liver iron overload associated paradoxically with normal to moderately elevated serum ferritin levels (Beaumont et al. 2006). Nigral iron accumulation and activation of NMDA receptors contribute to the neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease, and activation of NMDA receptors participates in iron metabolism in the hippocampus (Xu et al. 2018). NMDA receptor inhibitors MK-801 and AP5 protect nigrostriatal projection systems and reduce nigral iron levels. NMDA treatment increased the expression of DMT1 and decreased the expression of the iron exporter ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) (TC# 2.A.100.1.4) (Xu et al. 2018). DMT1 cannot be a direct donor of catalytic copper because it does not have the cytosol domain present in Ctr1, which is required for copper transfer to the Cu-chaperons that assist the formation of cuproenzymes (Ilyechova et al. 2019).

The metal-binding methionines play a role in restricting the substrates to monovalent heavy metals (Conroy et al., 2010). It has been reported to export L-cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006). Crystal structures of the CusA efflux pump suggested that methionine residues in a 3-methionine cluster, bind the metal as a transport intermediate (Long et al., 2010). Four methionine pairs in the transmembrane region, and one in the periplasmic domain may comprise the channel. Cu+ is exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic chaparone, CusF in the extracellular space (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2014). The Cus efflux system removes Cu+ and Ag+ from both the cell cytoplasm and the periplasm (Su et al., 2011b; Delmar et al. 2014). Metal-bound CusB is required for activation of Cu+ transfer from  CusF directly to a site in the CusA antiporter (Chac\u00f3n et al. 2014).

Lateral entry of substrates from the lipid bilayer into AcrB and its homologues has been proposed (Yu et al., 2003a; 2003b). [An asymmetric trimeric structure is established with AcrA having a hexameric structure, and TolC having a trimeric structure (Seeger et al., 2006]. A structure of a complex with YajC is also known (T\u00f6rnroth-Horsefield et al., 2007). A covalently linked trimer of AcrB provides evidence for a peristaltic pump, alternative access, rotation mechanism (Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2009;Nikaido and Takatsuka, 2009; Pos, 2009) Further evidence for a rotatory mechanisms stems from kinetic analyses for cephalosporin efflux which can exhibit positive cooperativity (Nagano and Nikaido, 2009). May also export signaling molecules for cell-cell communication (Yang et al., 2006). The substrates may be captured in the lower cleft region of AcrB, then transported through the binding pocket, the gate, and finally to the AcrA funnel that connects AcrB to TolC (Husain & Nikaido et al., 2010). AcrB has been converted into a light-driven proton pump using delta-rhodopsin (dR) linked to AcrB via a glycophorin A transmembrane domain. This created a solar powered protein capable of selectively capturing antibiotics from bulk solutions (Kapoor and Wendell 2013). The trimeric structure is essential for activity (Ye et al. 2014). Association with AcrZ (TC# 8.A.50), a small 1 TMS protein (49 aas) that modifies the substrate specificity of AcrAB, has been demonstrated (Hobbs et al. 2012). In a similar way, the binding of YajC to AcrB stimulates the export of ampicillin (T\u00f6rnroth-Horsefield et al. 2007). AcrZ binds to AcrB in a concave surface of the transmembrane domain (Du et al. 2015). Substrate binding accelerates conformational transitions and substrate dissociation, demonstrating cooperativity (Wang et al. 2015). The overall structure of AcrAB-TolC exemplifies the adaptor bridging model, wherein the funnel-like AcrA hexamer forms an intermeshing cogwheel interaction with the alpha-barrel tip region of TolC. Direct interaction between AcrB and TolC is not allowed (Kim et al. 2015). TMS2 in AcrB is required for lipophilic carboxylate binding. A groove shaped by the interface between TMS1 and TMS2 specifically binds fusidic acid and other lipophilic carboxylated drugs (Oswald et al. 2016). After ligand binding, a proton may bind to an acidic residue(s) in the transmembrane domain, i.e., Asp407 or Asp408, within the putative network of electrostatically interacting residues, which also include Lys940 and Thr978, and this may initiate a series of conformational changes that result in drug expulsion (Su et al. 2006). His978 is probably on the H+ pathway (Takatsuka and Nikaido 2006). AcrAB-TolC segregates to the old pole following cell division, causing the two daughter cells to exhibit different drug resistances (Bergmiller et al. 2017). The hoisting-loop is a highly flexible hinge that enables conformational energy transmission (Zwama et al. 2017). AcrB exhibits three distinct conformational states in the transport cycle, substrate access, binding, and extrusion, or loose (L), tight (T), and open (O) states, respectively (Yue et al. 2017). Simulations show that both Asp407 and Asp408 are deprotonated in the L\/T states, while only Asp408 is protonated in the O state. Release of a proton from Asp408 in the O state results in large conformational changes. Simulations offer dynamic details of how proton release drives the O-to-L transition in AcrB (Yue et al. 2017). The three-dimensional structures of the homo-trimer complexes of AcrB-like transporters, and a three-step functional rotation helps to explain the mechanism of transport, but a more comprehensive model has been proposed (Zhang et al. 2017). Preparation of the trimeric complex (AcrAB\/TolC) for cryo EM has been described (Du et al. 2018). The structural and energetic basis behind coupling functional rotation to proton translocation has been presented (Matsunaga et al. 2018). Protonation of transmembrane Asp408 in the drug-bound protomer drives rotation. The conformational pathway identifies vertical shear motions among several transmembrane helices, which regulate alternate access of water as well as peristaltic motions that pump drugs into the periplasm (Matsunaga et al. 2018). CryoEM of detergent-free AcrB preserves lipid-protein interactions for visualization and reveals how the lipids pack against the protein (Qiu et al. 2018). In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, resistance acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer in the presence of antibiotics with other modes of action (Nolivos et al. 2019). Multiple transport pathways within AcrB are tuned to substrate physicochemical properties related to the polyspecificity of the pump (Tam et al. 2019). The cryoEM structure of AcrB in an artificial membrane at 3.9 \u00c5 resolution has been solved (Yao et al. 2020). The indole-dependent transport mechanism has been examined (Jewel et al. 2020). AcrB subunits rimerize to form the minimal functional unit, stabilized noncovalently by helix-helix interactions between TMS 1 and TMS 8. Peptides resembling these two TMSs inhibit subunit associations and drug export activity (Jesin et al. 2020). AcrB cycles between three functionally interdependent protomers through the loose (L), tight (T) and open (O) states during cooperative catalysis.\u00a0Tam et al. 2021 presented 13 X-ray structures of AcrB in intermediate states of the transport cycle. Structure-based mutational analysis combined with drug susceptibility assays indicated that drugs are guided through dedicated transport channels toward the drug binding pockets.

NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency causes lysosomal retention of cholesterol, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and glycolipids as well as neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Infante et al. 2008a). Cholesterol binds to the sterol-sensing domain (Ohgami et al. 2004). Increased mitochondrial cholesterol, observed in NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency, causes oxidative stress and increased rates of glycolysis and lactate release (Kennedy et al. 2014). NPC1 binds cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and various oxysterols (Infante et al. 2008b; Liu et al., 2009 ). Soluble NPC2 binds cholesterol, and then passes it to the N-terminal domain of membranous NPC1 (Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009). Cholesterol trafficking in Niemann-Pick C-deficient cells was reviewed by Peake and Vance (2010). NPC1 is a late-endosomal membrane protein involved in trafficking of LDL- derived cholesterol, Niemann-Pick disease type C, and Ebola virus infection. It is the Ebola virus receptor. It contains 13 TMSs, five of which are thought to represent a \"sterol-sensing domain\", also present in other key regulatory proteins of cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, and signaling. A crystal structure of a large fragment of human NPC1 at 3.6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution revealed internal twofold pseudosymmetry along TMSs 2-13 and two structurally homologous domains that protrude 60\u00a0\u00c5 into the endosomal lumen (Li et al. 2016). NPC1's sterol sensing domain forms a cavity that is accessible from both the luminal bilayer leaflet and the endosomal lumen; this cavity is large enough to accommodate one cholesterol molecule. A model was proposed for cholesterol sensing and transport (Li et al. 2016). Lysosomal cholesterol activates TORC1 via an SLC38A9-Niemann-Pick C1 signaling complex (Castellano et al. 2017). Gong et al. 2016 presented a 4.4\u00a0\u00c5 structure of the full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution  reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. NPC1 contains three distinct lumenal  domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMSs 2-13 exhibit a typical RND fold, among which TMSs 3-7 constitute  the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in cholesterol\u00a0metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one NPC1 monomer through domain\u00a0C (Gong et al. 2016). The effects of disease-causing mutations on quality control pathways involving the lysosome and endoplasmic reticulum, and how it functions to clear the most common mutant protein found in Niemann-Pick type C patients have been reviewed (Schultz et al. 2016). In the same review, knowledge concerning the mechanisms that degrade misfolded transmembrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is presented. Cholesterol esters are components of low density lipoprotein (LDL), which is brought into the cells of various tissues by targeted endocytosis. Within the endosomes, cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed, releasing free cholesterol, which is finally exported out of the endosome by NPC1 with assistance from a soluble protein NPC2 (Nikaido 2018). The transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half (the SSD, sterol-sensing domain) of NPC1 are homologous to the sterol-binding domains of HMG-CoA reductase, as well as the regulator of  cholesterol-regulated transcription activation, SCAP. The domain that binds cholesterol with the highest affinity, within NPC1, however, is the NTD. In the NPC2-NPC1 complex, the substrate is captured at a location far away from the membrane by NPC2, and then is brought to a location close to the membrane surface (NTD of NPC1), and is finally moved to the intramembranous region of NPC1. Degradation occurs via two pathways, the proteasome following MARCH6-dependent ERAD, and an autophagic pathway called the selective ER autophagy (ER-phagy) (Schultz et al. 2018). NPC1 exports LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes by carrying it through the 80\u00a0\u00c5 glycocalyx and the 40\u00a0\u00c5 lipid bilayer. Transport begins when cholesterol binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, which projects to the surface of the glycocalyx.\u00a0Trinh et al. 2018 reconstituted cholesterol transport by expressing the NTD as a fragment separate from the remaining portion of NPC1. When co-expressed, the two NPC1 fragments reconstitute cholesterol transport and showed that cholesterol can be transferred from the NTD of one full-length NPC1 to another NPC1 molecule that lacks the NTD. The locations of buried amino acids and docking studies have identified putative lipid binding domains that are in close proximity to amino acids that, when mutated, are connected to NPC1 loss-of-function (Elghobashi-Meinhardt 2019). Niemann-Pick type C 1 function requires lumenal domain residues that mediate cholesterol-dependent NPC2 binding, and lysosomal cholesterol egress requires both NPC1 and NPC2.\u00a0Qian et al. 2020 presented systematic structural characterizations that revealed the molecular basis for low-pH-dependent cholesterol delivery from NPC2 to the transmembrane domain of NPC1. At pH 8.0, similar structures of NPC1 were obtained in nanodiscs and in detergent. A tunnel connecting the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD) was unveiled. At pH 5.5, the NTD exhibits two conformations, suggesting the motion for cholesterol delivery to the tunnel. A cholesterol molecule was found at the membrane boundary of the tunnel, and TMS2 moves toward formation of a surface pocket on the SSD. The structure of the NPC1-NPC2 complex at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution was obtained at pH 5.5, elucidating the molecular basis for cholesterol handoff from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD) (Qian et al. 2020). Genetic diversity in Niemann-Pick C1 can be managed through modulation of the Hsp70 chaperone system (Wang et al. 2020). The NPC1 protein is evolutionarily conserved with homologues reported in yeast to humans; NPC2 is present in C. elegans to humans. While neurons in mammalian models of NPC1 and NPC2 diseases exhibit many changes that are similar to those in humans (e.g., endosomal\/lysosomal storage, Golgi fragmentation, neuroaxonal dystrophy, neurodegeneration), a reduced degree of ectopic dendritogenesis and an absence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in these species suggest important differences in the way lower mammalian neurons respond to NPC1\/NPC2 loss of function (Walkley and Suzuki 2004). Cholesterol transport studies using wild-type NPC1 and the P691S mutant suggest changes in dynamical behavior as determined using molecular dynamics simulations (Elghobashi-Meinhardt 2020). NPC1 mutations cause variable disease phenotypes (Musalkova et al. 2020). Filoviruses, including marburgviruses and ebolaviruses, have a single transmembrane glycoprotein (GP) that facilitates their entry into cells. During entry, GP needs to be cleaved by host proteases to expose the receptor-binding site that binds to the endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein. Crystal structural analyses of the cleaved GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus (EBOV) in complex with human NPC1 has shown that NPC1 has two protruding loops (loops 1 and 2), which engage a hydrophobic pocket on the head of EBOV GPcl (Igarashi et al. 2021). Cholesterol docking studies, focusing on binding recognition, showed differences in the binding positions of mutant variants versus the wild-type protein (Mart\u00ednez-Archundia et al. 2020). Commonalities between Niemann-Pick C1 disease and other lysosomal storage disorders have been reviewed (Ya\u00f1ez et al. 2020). Cholesterol binding to the sterol-sensing region of the Niemann Pick C1 protein confines dynamics of its N-terminal domain (Dubey et al. 2020). Variants in the Niemann-Pick type C gene, NPC1, are probably not associated with Parkinson's disease (Ouled Amar Bencheikh et al. 2020). NPC1 exports low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. TMSs 3-7 of NPC1 comprise the Sterol-Sensing Domain (SSD). The anti-fungal drug itraconazole abolishes NPC1 activity in cells.\u00a0Long et al. 2020 reported a cryo-EM structure of human NPC1 bound to itraconazole, which reveals how this binding site in the center of NPC1 blocks a putative lumenal tunnel linked to the SSD. Blocking this tunnel abolishes NPC1-mediated cholesterol egress. The palmitate anchor of Hedgehog occupies a similar site in the homologous tunnel of Patched, suggesting a conserved mechanism for sterol transport in this family of proteins and establishing a central function of their SSDs. Npc1, acting in neurons and glia, is essential for the formation and maintenance of CNS myelin (Yu and Lieberman 2013). In contrast to the benign Q92S mutation, Q92R reduces electrostatic potential around S-opening, and thus likely affects the NPC1 (NTD)-NPC2 interaction and\/or cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to NPC1 (Petukh and Zhulin 2018). In the somatosensory neocortex, NPC1 plays a role in synaptic function (Avchalumov et al. 2012). Lysosomes receive extracellular and intracellular cholesterol and redistribute it throughout the cell. Cholesterol egress from lysosomes is critical for cholesterol homeostasis, and its failure underlies the pathogenesis of genetic disorders such as Niemann-Pick C disease. Anderson et al. 2022 reported that the BORC-ARL8-HOPS ensemble is required for egress of free cholesterol from lysosomes and for storage of esterified cholesterol in lipid droplets. Depletion of BORC, ARL8 or HOPS does not alter the localization of the lysosomal transmembrane cholesterol transporter NPC1 to degradative compartments, but decreases the association of the luminal transporter NPC2 and increases NPC2 secretion. BORC-ARL8-HOPS depletion also increases lysosomal degradation of CI-MPR, which normally sorts NPC2 to the endosomal-lysosomal system and then is recycled to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). These defects likely result from impaired HOPS-dependent fusion of endosomal-lysosomal organelles and an uncharacterized function of HOPS in CI-MPR recycling. Thus, the BORC-ARL8-HOPS ensemble is required for cholesterol egress from lysosomes by enabling CI-MPR-dependent trafficking of NPC2 to the endosomal-lysosomal system (Anderson et al. 2022). Members of this familly have the NPC1 fold (Ferrada and Superti-Furga 2022).","2":"PBDID: 3GKH  PBDID: 3GKI  PBDID: 3GKJ  PBDID: 3jd8  PBDID: 5i31  PBDID: 5F18  PBDID: 5F1B  PBDID: 5HNS  PBDID: 5JNX  PBDID: 5KWY  PBDID: 5U73  PBDID: 5U74  PBDID: 6UOX  PBDID: 6W5R  PBDID: 6W5S  PBDID: 6W5T  PBDID: 6W5U  PBDID: 6W5V  PBDID: 5KWY  PBDID: 6W5V"},{"0":"2.A.6.6.13","1":"Patched, PTCH1, Ptc1 or PTCH, SLC65 family) of 1447 aas and 12 TMSs. RND transporter-like receptor, regulates the activity of Smoothened of 7 TMSs via the Hedgehog (HH) pathway. The Na+ gradient may provide the energy for Patched activity (Myers et al. 2017). Possibly Patched1, chemiosmotically driven by the transmembrane Na+ gradient, regulates Smoothened. 3-d structures have been solved at ~ 3.5 \u00c5 resolution by cryoEM (Qi et al. 2018). This protein seems to have both transport and signalling functions, exporting cholesterol from the inner leaflet of the membrane out to the external environment. It displays a tunnel going through the membrane with a lateral opening, all large enough to accomodate cholesterol (Qi et al. 2018; Sommer and Lemmon 2018). The distrutribution of Smoothened on the primary cillium surface has been studied (Yoon et al. 2019). Hedgehog protein signals mediate tissue patterning and maintenance by binding to and inactivating their common receptor Patched that suppresses the activity of the 7-TMS protein Smoothened. Loss of Patched function, the most common cause of basal cell carcinoma, permits unregulated activation of Smoothened and of the Hedgehog pathway. A cryo-EM structure of Patched revealed striking transmembrane domain similarities to prokaryotic RND transporters in whick a central hydrophobic conduit with cholesterol-like contents courses through the extracellular domain and resembles that used by other RND proteins to transport substrates, suggesting that Patched catalyzes cholesterol transport (Zhang et al. 2018). Cholesterol in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is reduced by PTCH1 expression but rapidly restored by Hedgehog stimulation, suggesting that PTCH1 regulates Smoothened by controlling cholesterol availability. Key proteins in the Hedgehog-signalling pathway dynamically localize in primary cilia, antenna-like solitary organelles present on most cells. The secreted Hedgehog ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) binds to its receptor Patched1 (PTCH1) in primary cilia, causing its inactivation and delocalization from cilia. At the same time, the transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO or SMOH; TC# 9.A.14.16.4) is released of its inhibition by PTCH1 and accumulates in cilia. PTCH1 inactivation by SHH changes the diffusive motion of PTCH1 (Weiss et al. 2019). PTCH1 is mutated in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) (Nakase et al. 2020). Patched (Ptc1) acts as a suppressor for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by depleting sterols in the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet that are required for the activation of downstream regulators. The positive modulator Hh inhibits Ptc1's transport function by binding to Ptc1 and its co-receptors, which are locally concentrated in invaginated microdomains known as caveolae.\u00a0Luo et al. 2021 reconstituted the mouse Ptc1 into lipid nanodiscs and determined its structure by cryoEM. The structure is similar to those in amphipol and detergents but displays various conformational differences in the transmembrane region. Although most particles are monomers, Ptc1 dimers were also observed with distinct interaction patterns and different membrane curvatures, some of which are reminiscent of caveolae. An extramembranous \"hand-shake\" region, rich in hydrophobic and aromatic residues, mediates inter-Ptc1 interactions under conditions of different membrane curvature, providing a plausible framework for Ptc1 clustering in the highly curved caveolae (Luo et al. 2021). Cholesterol regulates reception of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal in target cells. In vertebrates, cell-surface organelles called primary cilia function as compartments for the propagation of Hh signals. Various studies have led to the model that Patched-1 (PTCH1), the receptor for Hh ligands, uses its transporter-like activity to lower cholesterol accessibility in the membrane surrounding primary cilia (Kinnebrew et al. 2022). PTCH1 depletes accessible cholesterol in the outer leaflet of the membrane in a manner regulated by its ligand Sonic Hedgehog and the transmembrane potassium gradient.\u00a0Kinnebrew et al. 2021 proposed that PTCH1 moves cholesterol from the outer to the inner leaflet of the membrane in exchange for potassium ion export.","2":"PBDID: 6DMB  PBDID: 6DMO  PBDID: 6DMY  PBDID: 6E1H  PBDID: 6N7G  PBDID: 6N7H  PBDID: 6N7K  PBDID: 6OEU  PBDID: 6OEV  PBDID: 6RMG  PBDID: 6RTW  PBDID: 6RTX  PBDID: 6RTY  PBDID: 6RVC  PBDID: 6RVD"},{"0":"2.A.6.6.3","1":"Yeast sterol transport system consisting of two proteins, NCR1 (YPL006w) and NPC2 (YDL046w), components of the Niemann-Pick Type C transporter.

Expression of yeast NP-C-related gene 1 (NCR1), the orthologue of the human NP-C gene 1 (NPC1) defective in the disease, in Chinese hamster ovary NPC1 mutant cells suppressed lipid accumulation (Malathi et al. 2004). Deletion of NCR1, encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly residing in the vacuole of normal yeast, gave no phenotype. However, a dominant mutation in the putative sterol-sensing domain of Ncr1p conferred temperature and polyene antibiotic sensitivity without changes in sterol metabolism. Instead, the mutant cells were resistant to inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis and super sensitive to sphingosine and C2-ceramide. Plasma membrane sphingolipids accumulated and redistributed to the vacuole and other subcellular membranes of the mutant cells.\u00a0Malathi et al. 2004 proposed that the primordial function of these proteins is to recycle sphingolipids, and that defects in this process in higher eukaryotes secondarily result in cholesterol accumulation.

NCR1 has its N-terminal domain (NTD) positioned to deliver a sterol to a tunnel connecting the NTD to the luminal membrane leaflet, 50\u00a0\u00c5 away. A sterol is caught inside this tunnel during transport, and a proton-relay network of charged residues in the transmembrane region is linked to this tunnel, supporting a proton-driven transport mechanism.

Dietary cholesterol induces trafficking of the intestinal NPC1L1 from the brush boarder to endosomes (Skov et al. 2011). It distributes on the brush border membranes of enterocytes and the canalicular membranes of hepatocytes. It is the target of ezetimibe, a hypocholesterolemic drug which blocks internalization of NPC1L1 and cholesterol in the mouse small intestine (Wang and Song 2012; Xie et al. 2012). Human NPC1L1 is a 1,332-amino acid protein with a putative sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that shows sequence homology to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). NPC1L1 may have evolved at two sites (apical membrane of enterocytes and canalicular membrane of hepatocytes) to mediate cholesterol uptake through a clathrin-mediated endocytic process, protecting the body against fecal and biliary loss of cholesterol (Yu 2008). NPC1L1-dependent intestinal cholesterol absorption appears to require ganglioside GM3 in membrane microdomains (Nihei et al. 2018). Ezetimibe is the only inhibitor of NPC1L1 available for clinical use, but aminoss-lactam ezetimibe derivatives may also be effective (Pirillo et al. 2016). The cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, acts by blocking the sterol-induced internalization of NPC1L1 (Ge et al. 2008). Otopetrin 1 activation by purinergic nucleotides regulates intracellular calcium ions (Hughes et al. 2007). NPC1L1 plays a major role in the intestinal absorption of biliary cholesterol, vitamin E, and vitamin K. The drug ezetimibe inhibits NPC1L1-mediated absorption of cholesterol, lowering of circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Long et al. 2021 reported cryoEM structures of human NPC1L1 bound to either cholesterol or a lipid resembling vitamin E. The same intramolecular channel in hNPC1L1 mediates transport of vitamin E and cholesterol. hNPC1L1 exists primarily as a homodimer; dimerization is mediated by aromatic residues within a region of TMS 2 that exhibits a horizonal orientation in the membrane. Mutation of tryptophan-347, lieing in this region, disrupts dimerization, and the resultant monomeric NPC1L1 exhibits reduced efficiency of cholesterol uptake (Long et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 3QNT"},{"0":"2.A.6.9.1","1":"Dispatched is an exporter of the amino-terminal portion (19 kDa) of the C-terminally cholesterol-modified peptide, hedgehog; sterol sensor protein (Ma et al., 2002).

The intracellular movement of this Hedgehog signal is complex, and involves insertion into the apical cell membrane, followed by endocytosis, and then secretion at the basolateral membrane by Dispatched (Nikaido 2018).  Dispatched shows a typical RND protein folding pattern, although its overall sequence similarity to Patched or NPC1 is low. However, it contains the typical sterol sensing domain, similar to those found in NPC1 as well as in Patched. Hedgehog anchored by glycosylphophatidylinositol, rather than cholesterol, was not exported by Dispatched, suggesting that  the cholesterol anchor is recognized by the transporter.  Finally, the secretion of Hedgehog by Dispatched across the membrane requires help by other proteins, including a secreted soluble protein called Scube (Nikaido 2018).","2":"PBDID: 6TBU  PBDID: 6TD6"},{"0":"2.A.60.1.19","1":"Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member, OATP2A1; SLCO2A1; (Prostaglandin uptake transporter, PGT) (Solute carrier family 21 member 1 or 2).

Early contacts between substrate proteins and TatA have been demonstrated (Fr\u00f6bel et al., 2011). TatC helix 5 and the TatB transmembrane helix interact (Kneuper et al., 2012). TatC functions as an obligate oligomer (Cleon et al. 2015). TatA is the most abundant component of the complex and facilitates assembly of this complex.It exhibits a uniform distribution throughout the inner membrane, but forms linear clusters upon increased expression of TatBC (Smith et al. 2017). TatA and TatB both have the capacity to bind at two TatC sites, one in TMS5 and one in TMS6 (Habersetzer et al. 2017). However in vivo this is regulated according to the activation state of the complex. In the resting-state system, TatB binds the polar cluster site in TMS 5 with TatA occupying the site in TMS 6. However, when the system is activated by overproduction of a substrate, TatA and TatB switch binding sites. Habersetzer et al. 2017 proposed that this substrate-triggered positional exchange is a key step in the assembly of an active Tat translocase. A highly conserved glutamate residue in the transmembrane region of E. coli TatC, which, when modified by DCCD, interferes with the deep insertion of a Tat signal peptide into the TatBC receptor complex (Bl\u00fcmmel et al. 2017). Different from TatA but rather like TatB, TatE contacts a Tat signal peptide independently of the proton-motive force and restricts the premature processing of a Tat signal peptide (Eimer et al. 2018). Furthermore, TatE embarks at the transmembrane helix five of TatC where it becomes so closely spaced to TatB that both proteins can be covalently linked by a zero-space cross-linker. This suggests that in addition to TatB and TatC, TatE is a component of the Tat substrate receptor complex. A bioinformatic analysis revealed a relatively broad distribution of tatE genes in bacterial phyla and highlights unique protein sequence features of TatE orthologs (Eimer et al. 2018).","2":"PBDID: 2LZR  PBDID: 2LZS  PBDID: 2MN6  PBDID: 2MN7"},{"0":"2.A.64.3.1","1":"TatAd\/Bd translocase (Jongbloed et al., 2004)","2":"PBDID: 2L16"},{"0":"2.A.66.1.10","1":"Na -dependent cationic drug (ethidium, acriflavine, 2-N-methyl ellipticinium, berberine, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, rhodamine 6G, crystal violet, doxorubicin, novobiocin, enoxacin, and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride) efflux pump, NorM (Long et al. 2008). 3-d structures of the N. gonorrheae NorM transporter (96% identical to the N. miningitidis protein) have been solved complexed with three different substrates in a multidrug cavity and Cs (4HUN; Lu et al. 2013).

MurJ has 14 TMSs, and specific charged residues localized in the central cavity are essential for function. This structural homology model suggests that MurJ functions as an essential transporter in PG biosynthesis (Butler et al. 2013). Based on an in vivo assay, MurJ is a flippase for the lipid-linked cell wall precursors, polyisoprenoid-linked disaccharide-peptapeptides (Sham et al. 2014).

These authors reported two crystal structures of inward-facing forms from Arsenophonus endosymbiont MurJ and a crystal structure of E. coli MurJ in a \"squeezed\" form, which lacks a cavity to accommodate the substrate, mainly because of the increased proximity of transmembrane helices 2 and 8.

Each subunit of the transporter contains nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins that suggest a pathway for substrate transport. YdaH could act as an antibiotic efflux pump and mediate bacterial resistance to sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs (Bolla et al. 2015).

This pump confers resistance to a wide range of disinfectants and dyes known as quaternary cation compounds (QCCs). The 3-D structure of the dimeric EmrE shows opposite orientation of the two subunits in the membrane (Chen et al., 2007), and this conclusion has been confirmed (Fleishman et al. 2006; Lehner et al. 2008; Lloris-Garcer\u00e1 et al. 2013). There may be a single intermediate state in which the substrate is occluded and immobile (Basting et al., 2008). Direct interaction between substrates (tetraphenylphosphonium, TPP+ and MTP+) and Glu14 in TMS1 has been demonstrated using solid state NMR (Ong et al. 2013). A Gly90X6Gly97 motif is important for dimer formation (Elbaz et al., 2008). Two models may account for the opposite (inverted) orientations of the two identical subunits. A post-translational model posits that topology remains malleable after synthesis and becomes fixed once the dimer forms. A second, co-translational model, posits that the protein inserts in both topologies in equal proportions (Woodall et al. 2015). Protonation of E14 leads to rotation and tilt of transmembrane helices 1-3 in conjunction with repacking of loops, conformational changes that alter the coordination of the bound substrate and modulate its access to the binding site from the lipid bilayer. The transport model that emerges posits a proton-bound, but occluded, resting state. Substrate binding from the inner leaflet of the bilayer releases the protons and triggers alternating access between inward- and outward-facing conformations of the substrate-loaded transporter, thus enabling antiport without dissipation of the proton gradient (Dastvan et al. 2016). TMS4 is the known dimerization domain of EmrE (Julius et al. 2017). Few conserved residues are essential for drug polyselectivity. Aromatic QCC selection involves a greater portion of conserved residues compared to other QCCs (Saleh et al. 2018).  The topologies of helical membrane proteins are generally defined during insertion of the transmembrane helices, yet topology can change after insertion. In EmrE, topology flipping occurs so that the populations in both orientations equalize. Woodall et al. 2017 demonstrated that when EmrE is forced to insert in a distorted topology, topology flipping of the first TMS can occur, and topological malleability also extends to the C-terminal helix; even complete inversion of the entire EmrE protein can occur after the full protein is translated and inserted. Thus, topological rearrangements appear to be possible during biogenesis. Subtle but significant differences in the sizes of EmrE with different QCC ligands bound has been reported (Qazi and Turner 2018). The two Glu14 residues in the dimer have independent pKa values and are not electrostatically coupled (Li et al. 2021).

The 3-d structure has been determined to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution showing that it is a hexamer with each protomer having a central pore surrounded by 6 TMSs (Sun et al. 2018) (see family description for more details). Wu et al. 2019 suggested that channel opeining involves repacking of key residues, such as Gln50 and Phe17, as well as the subsequent outward movement of all transmembrane helices. Their simulations suggested that acetate is always surrounded by several water molecules when passing through the anion channel, and a high energy barrier of 15 kcal\/mol was observed (Wu et al. 2019). SatP from Citrobacter koseri (92% identical to the E. coli ortholog) in liposomes and native nanodiscs has been examined structurally using solid state NMR, revealing the common helical structures in their transmembrane domains (Dong et al. 2021). It is not certain that SatP is a carrier or a channel.","2":"PBDID: 5ZUG"},{"0":"2.A.97.1.2","1":"Mitochondrial distribution and morphology protein Mdm38p (Yol027c)","2":"PBDID: 3SKQ"},{"0":"2.C.1.1.1","1":"The TonB energy-transducing system.

May function in phospholipid transport (SS Chng, personal communication). Cells lacking  the Tol-Pal complex exhibit defects in lipid asymmetry and accumulate excess phospholipids (PLs) in the OM. This imbalance in OM lipids is due to defective retrograde PL transport in the absence of a functional Tol-Pal complex. Thus, cells ensure the assembly of a stable OM by maintaining an excess flux of PLs to the OM only to return the surplus to the inner membrane via transport mediated by the Tol-Pal complex (Shrivastava et al. 2017). The specific function of the Tol-Pal complex may be to transport lipids  from the outer leaflet of the outer membrane to the inner leaflet of the outer member. The Tol-Pal complex is essential to maintain polar localization of the MCP chemotaxis receptor complex (Santos et al. 2014). The Tol-Pal complex, energized by TolQRA, and using the outer membrane proteins, BtuB and OmpF as receptors, is responsible for the uptake of colicin ColE9 and other bacteriocins; in this process, the complex in the outer membrane bridges and immobilizes the complex components in the inner membrane (Rassam et al. 2018).","2":"PBDID: 1S62  PBDID: 1TOL  PBDID: 3QDR  PBDID: 3QDP  PBDID: 2WZ7  PBDID: 2XDJ  PBDID: 6G5S  PBDID: 1C5K  PBDID: 1CRZ  PBDID: 2HQS  PBDID: 2IVZ  PBDID: 2W8B  PBDID: 3IAX"},{"0":"2.D.1.1.2","1":"Oxysterol binding protein-related, Orp8 protein of 889 aas and 1 C-terminal TMS in the ER membrane.

The 3-D structure has been reported by Oldham et al. (2007). An altering access mechanism has been suggested for the maltose transporter resulting from rigid-body rotations (Khare et al., 2009). The maltose-binding protein is open in the catalytic transition state for ATP hydrolysis during maltose transport (Austermuhle et al. 2004). Bordignon et al. (2010) and Schneider et al. (2012) reviewed the extensive knowledge available on MalEFGK2, its mode of action and its regulatory interactions. The transporter sequesters the MalT transcriptional activator at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane in the absence of the transport substrate (Richet et al. 2012). The crystal structures of the transporter complex MBP-MalFGK2 bound with  large malto-oligosaccharide in two different conformational states have also been determined. In the pretranslocation structure,\u00a0Oldham et al. 2013 found that the transmembrane subunit MalG forms two hydrogen bonds with malto-oligosaccharide at the reducing  end. In the outward-facing conformation, the transmrembrane subunit MalF  binds three glucosyl units from the nonreducing end. These  structural features explain why large modified malto-oligosaccharides are not  transported by MalFGK2 despite their high binding affinity to MBP. In the transport cycle, substrate is channeled from MBP into the transmembrane pathway with a polarity such that both MBP and MalFGK2 contribute to the overall substrate selectivity of the system (Oldham et al. 2013). Stabilization of the semi-open MalK2 conformation by maltose-bound MBP is key to the coupling of maltose transport to ATP hydrolysis in vivo, because it facilitates the progression of the MalK dimer from the open to the semi-open conformation, from which it can proceed to hydrolyze ATP (Alvarez et al. 2015). Both the binding of MalE to the periplasmic side of the transmembrane complex and binding of ATP to MalK2 are necessary to facilitate the conformational change from the inward-facing state to the occluded state, in which MalK2 is completely dimerized (Hsu et al. 2017). An integrated transport mechanism of the maltose ABC importer has been proposed (M\u00e4chtel et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 2R6G  PBDID: 3FH6  PBDID: 3PUV  PBDID: 3PUW  PBDID: 3PUX  PBDID: 3PUY  PBDID: 3PUZ  PBDID: 3PV0  PBDID: 3RLF  PBDID: 4JBW  PBDID: 4KHZ  PBDID: 4KI0  PBDID: 1A7L  PBDID: 1ANF  PBDID: 1DMB  PBDID: 1EZ9  PBDID: 1EZO  PBDID: 1EZP  PBDID: 1FQA  PBDID: 1FQB  PBDID: 1FQC  PBDID: 1FQD  PBDID: 1HSJ  PBDID: 1IUD  PBDID: 1JVX  PBDID: 1JVY  PBDID: 1JW4  PBDID: 1JW5  PBDID: 1LAX  PBDID: 1LLS  PBDID: 1MDP  PBDID: 1MDQ  PBDID: 1MG1  PBDID: 1MH3  PBDID: 1MH4  PBDID: 1MPB  PBDID: 1MPC  PBDID: 1MPD  PBDID: 1N3W  PBDID: 1N3X  PBDID: 1NL5  PBDID: 1NMU  PBDID: 1OMP  PBDID: 1PEB  PBDID: 1R6Z  PBDID: 1SVX  PBDID: 1T0K  PBDID: 1Y4C  PBDID: 1YTV  PBDID: 1ZIU  PBDID: 1ZJL  PBDID: 1ZKB  PBDID: 1ZMG  PBDID: 2D21  PBDID: 2H25  PBDID: 2KLF  PBDID: 2NVU  PBDID: 2OBG  PBDID: 2OK2  PBDID: 2R6G  PBDID: 2V93  PBDID: 2VGQ  PBDID: 2ZXT  PBDID: 3A3C  PBDID: 3C4M  PBDID: 3CSB  PBDID: 3CSG  PBDID: 3DM0  PBDID: 3EHS  PBDID: 3EHT  PBDID: 3EHU  PBDID: 3F5F  PBDID: 3G7V  PBDID: 3G7W  PBDID: 3H3G  PBDID: 3HPI  PBDID: 3IO4  PBDID: 3IO6  PBDID: 3IOR  PBDID: 3IOT  PBDID: 3IOU  PBDID: 3IOV  PBDID: 3IOW  PBDID: 3KJT  PBDID: 3L2J  PBDID: 3MBP  PBDID: 4MBP  PBDID: 2MV0  PBDID: 2N44  PBDID: 2N45  PBDID: 3H4Z  PBDID: 3HST  PBDID: 3J9P  PBDID: 3LBS  PBDID: 3LC8  PBDID: 3MP1  PBDID: 3MP6  PBDID: 3MP8  PBDID: 3MQ9  PBDID: 3N94  PBDID: 3O3U  PBDID: 3OSR  PBDID: 3PGF  PBDID: 3PUV  PBDID: 3PUW  PBDID: 3PUX  PBDID: 3PUY  PBDID: 3PUZ  PBDID: 3PV0  PBDID: 3PY7  PBDID: 3Q25  PBDID: 3Q26  PBDID: 3Q27  PBDID: 3Q28  PBDID: 3Q29  PBDID: 3RLF  PBDID: 3RUM  PBDID: 3SER  PBDID: 3SES  PBDID: 3SET  PBDID: 3SEU  PBDID: 3SEV  PBDID: 3SEW  PBDID: 3SEX  PBDID: 3SEY  PBDID: 3VFJ  PBDID: 3W15  PBDID: 3WAI  PBDID: 3WOA  PBDID: 4B3N  PBDID: 4BL8  PBDID: 4BL9  PBDID: 4BLA  PBDID: 4BLB  PBDID: 4BLD  PBDID: 4DXB  PBDID: 4DXC  PBDID: 4EDQ  PBDID: 4EGC  PBDID: 4EXK  PBDID: 4FE8  PBDID: 4FEB  PBDID: 4FEC  PBDID: 4FED  PBDID: 4GIZ  PBDID: 4GLI  PBDID: 4IFP  PBDID: 4IKM  PBDID: 4IRL  PBDID: 4JBZ  PBDID: 4JKM  PBDID: 4KEG  PBDID: 4KHZ  PBDID: 4KI0  PBDID: 4KV3  PBDID: 4KYC  PBDID: 4KYD  PBDID: 4KYE  PBDID: 4N4X  PBDID: 4NDZ  PBDID: 4O2X  PBDID: 4OGM  PBDID: 4PE2  PBDID: 4QSZ  PBDID: 4R0Y  PBDID: 4RWF  PBDID: 4RWG  PBDID: 4TSM  PBDID: 4WJV  PBDID: 4WMS  PBDID: 4WMT  PBDID: 4WMU  PBDID: 4WMV  PBDID: 4WMW  PBDID: 4WMX  PBDID: 4QVH  PBDID: 4RG5  PBDID: 4WVH  PBDID: 4XAJ  PBDID: 5C7R  PBDID: 5DIS  PBDID: 2XZ3  PBDID: 3D4C  PBDID: 3D4G  PBDID: 3EF7  PBDID: 3OAI  PBDID: 3OB4  PBDID: 4H1G  PBDID: 4LOG  PBDID: 4NUF  PBDID: 4PQK  PBDID: 4WRN  PBDID: 4WTH  PBDID: 4XA2  PBDID: 4XHS  PBDID: 4XR8  PBDID: 4XZS  PBDID: 4XZV  PBDID: 5AQ9  PBDID: 5AZ6  PBDID: 5AZ7  PBDID: 5AZ8  PBDID: 5AZ9  PBDID: 5AZA  PBDID: 5B3W  PBDID: 5B3X  PBDID: 5B3Y  PBDID: 5B3Z  PBDID: 5BK1  PBDID: 5BK2  PBDID: 5CBN  PBDID: 5CFV  PBDID: 5DFM  PBDID: 5E24  PBDID: 5E7U  PBDID: 5EDU  PBDID: 5FIO  PBDID: 5FSG  PBDID: 5GRU  PBDID: 5GS2  PBDID: 5GXT  PBDID: 5GXV  PBDID: 5H7N  PBDID: 5H7Q  PBDID: 5HZV  PBDID: 5HZW  PBDID: 5I04  PBDID: 5I69  PBDID: 5IHJ  PBDID: 5II5  PBDID: 5IIC  PBDID: 5IQZ  PBDID: 5JQE  PBDID: 5JST  PBDID: 5M13  PBDID: 5M14  PBDID: 5M15  PBDID: 5MM3  PBDID: 5OSQ  PBDID: 5T03  PBDID: 5T05  PBDID: 5T0A  PBDID: 5TTD  PBDID: 5VAW  PBDID: 5WPZ  PBDID: 5WQ6  PBDID: 5Y2G  PBDID: 5YEV  PBDID: 5YGP  PBDID: 5YGS  PBDID: 5Z0R  PBDID: 5Z0V  PBDID: 5ZCA  PBDID: 5ZNY  PBDID: 5ZNZ  PBDID: 5ZR0  PBDID: 6AEO  PBDID: 6APX  PBDID: 6CXS  PBDID: 6D65  PBDID: 6D66  PBDID: 6D67  PBDID: 6DBI  PBDID: 6DBJ  PBDID: 6DBL  PBDID: 6DBO  PBDID: 6DBQ  PBDID: 6DBR  PBDID: 6DBT  PBDID: 6DBU  PBDID: 6DBV  PBDID: 6DBW  PBDID: 6DBX  PBDID: 6DM8  PBDID: 6EQZ  PBDID: 6HD8  PBDID: 6HD9  PBDID: 6HDA  PBDID: 6HDB  PBDID: 6HDC  PBDID: 6I4Y  PBDID: 6K7D  PBDID: 6K7E  PBDID: 6K7F  PBDID: 6KEA  PBDID: 6KI0  PBDID: 6LES  PBDID: 6LF3  PBDID: 6M4V  PBDID: 6M4W  PBDID: 6N84  PBDID: 6NDJ  PBDID: 6OB5  PBDID: 6P6W  PBDID: 6QUG  PBDID: 6QYK  PBDID: 6QYL  PBDID: 6QYN  PBDID: 6QYO  PBDID: 6QZ7  PBDID: 6SIV  PBDID: 6SJA  PBDID: 6SLM  PBDID: 6SMV  PBDID: 6SWR  PBDID: 6TZC  PBDID: 6V2E  PBDID: 6VLS  PBDID: 6WBH  PBDID: 6WBJ  PBDID: 6ZHO  PBDID: 2R6G  PBDID: 3FH6  PBDID: 3PUV  PBDID: 3PUW  PBDID: 3PUX  PBDID: 3PUY  PBDID: 3PUZ  PBDID: 3PV0  PBDID: 3RLF  PBDID: 4JBW  PBDID: 4KI0  PBDID: 1Q12  PBDID: 1Q1B  PBDID: 1Q1E  PBDID: 2AWN  PBDID: 2AWO  PBDID: 2R6G  PBDID: 3FH6  PBDID: 3GD7  PBDID: 3PUV  PBDID: 3PUW  PBDID: 3PUX  PBDID: 3PUY  PBDID: 3PUZ  PBDID: 3PV0  PBDID: 3RLF  PBDID: 4JBW  PBDID: 4KI0"},{"0":"3.A.1.1.10","1":"Alginate (MW 27,000 Da) (and Alginate oligosaccharides) uptake porter. ABC transport system, AlgQ1AlgM1AlgM2(AlgS)2: AlgS, 363 aas, BAB03314; AlgQ1, 502 aas, 3VLW_A; AlgM1, 324 aas, BAB03315.1; AlgM2, 293 aas, BAB03316.1. Sphingomonas species A1 is a 'pit-forming' bacterium that directly incorporates alginate into its cytoplasm through a pit-dependent transport system, termed a 'superchannel' (Murata et al., 2008). The pit is a novel organ acquired through the fluidity and reconstitution of cell surface molecules, and through cooperation with the transport machinery in the cells. It confers upon bacterial cells a more efficient way to secure and assimilate macromolecules (Murata et al., 2008). The substrate-transport characteristics and quaternary structure of AlgM1M2SS with AlgQ1 have been determined (Maruyama et al. 2015). The addition of poly- or oligoalginate enhanced the ATPase activity of reconstituted AlgM1M2SS coupled with one of the periplasmic solute-binding proteins, AlgQ1 or AlgQ2. External fluorescence-labeled oligoalginates were specifically imported into AlgM1M2SS-containing proteoliposomes in the presence of AlgQ2, ATP, and Mg2+. The crystal structure of AlgQ2-bound AlgM1M2SS adopts an inward-facing conformation. The interaction between AlgQ2 and AlgM1M2SS induces the formation of an alginate-binding tunnel-like structure accessible to solvent. The translocation route inside the transmembrane domains contains charged residues suitable for the import of acidic saccharides (Maruyama et al. 2015). This bacterium is a Gram-negative rod, containing glycosphingolipids in the cell envelope, and is named Sphingomonas sp. strain A1 (Murata et al. 2022). The pit was dynamic, with repetitive opening and closing during growth on alginate, and directly included alginate concentrated around the pit, particularly by flagellins, alginate-binding proteins, localized on the cell surface. Alginate incorporated into the periplasm was subsequently transferred to the cytoplasm by cooperative interactions of periplasmic solute-binding proteins and an ATP-binding cassette transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. The mechanisms of assembly, functions, and interactions between the above-mentioned molecules were clarified using structural biology. The pit was transplanted into other strains of sphingomonads, and the pitted recombinant cells were effectively applied to the production of bioethanol, bioremediation for dioxin removal (Murata et al. 2022). The outer membranes of Sphingomonas strains contain GSL and is different from that of other Gram-negative bacteria, which contain LPSs in their cell envelope. Because of this property, the cell surface of Sphingomonas strains is more hydrophobic than that of other Gram-negative bacteria and shows high affinity toward hydrophobic chemicals such as dioxin and polypropylene glycol. Strain A1 cells use polyuronates (alginate and pectin) and their depolymerization products as carbon sources for growth. Glucose and pyruvate can be utilized as carbon sources, but far less efficiently than polyuronates.  Strain A1 cells grew well on alginate and oligoalginates with different  M\/G ratios at pH 6\u20137, 30 \u00e2\u0084\u0083 in aerobic conditions, with a doubling time of approximately 25 min. However, unlike almost all of the alginate-degrading bacteria analyzed to date, the cells of strain A1 contained most of their alginate lyases in the cytoplasm. This  means that alginate in the medium has to enter the cells in order to make contact with alginate lyases (Murata et al. 2022). The morphological characteristics of the cell surface were examined with  cells of strain A1 grown in the presence or absence of alginate. The following morphological observations were made (Murata et al. 2022): (i) cells grown on alginate were of two types that always coexisted in the medium: cells with or without a pit,  and this feature was not observed in the absence of alginate. (ii) The surface of cells grown in the absence of alginate showed a pleat-like structure without a pit. (iii) Cells grown in the presence of alginate produced pits on their cell surface, and  The pits contained even globular particles, some of which were insoluble forms (granules) of alginate. (iv) When the alginate-grown cells were treated with ruthenium red, an agent used to stain mucopolysaccharides, the pit periphery was strongly and specifically stained,  suggesting that alginate was concentrated in the pit. (v) The thin section of cells grown on alginate showed a specific region where the cell surface sunk into the cells but no such structures were observed in cells grown in the absence of alginate. (vi) The average pit size was 0.02\u20130.1 \u00b5m in diameter (Murata et al. 2022). Thus, (a) the pit is formed only in the presence of alginate, (b) the pit functions as a concentrator of alginate, and (c) strain A1 cells have a pit-dependent alginate assimilation system, which differs from the alginate import and degradation pathway of other alginate-degrading microbes. There are six protein constituents in the ABC transporter: AlgQ1, Q2,  M1 M2 and S (AlgS is present with two copies where Q1 and 2 are periplasmic binding proteins, M1 and M2 comprise the integral membrane transport channel, and S is the dimeric ATPase. Alginate accumulated in the pit is delivered into the periplasm and then  transported to the cytoplasm by this ABC transporter. Alginate is finally degraded into constituent monosaccharides by alginate lyases present in the cytoplasm. The gene cluster encoding these proteins are AlgO (regulatory protein)-AlgS-AlgM1-AlgM2-AlgQ1-AlgQ2. There are 8 cell  surface proteins, p1 - p8. P1 - p4 are TonB-dependent outer membrane transporters; p5 and p6 are flagellin-like proteins with alterred central domains of ~150 aas and high affinity for alginate (Kd = 10-9), and p7 and p8 are periplasmic alginate binding proteins (Murata et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 1Y3N  PBDID: 1Y3P  PBDID: 1Y3Q  PBDID: 3A09  PBDID: 3VLU  PBDID: 3VLV  PBDID: 3VLW  PBDID: 4TQU  PBDID: 4TQV  PBDID: 4XIG  PBDID: 4XTC  PBDID: 4TQU  PBDID: 4TQV  PBDID: 4XIG  PBDID: 4XTC  PBDID: 4TQU  PBDID: 4TQV  PBDID: 4XIG  PBDID: 4XTC"},{"0":"3.A.1.1.13","1":"Glucose, mannose, galactose porter","2":"PBDID: 1OXS  PBDID: 1OXT  PBDID: 1OXU  PBDID: 1OXV  PBDID: 1OXX"},{"0":"3.A.1.1.16","1":"Maltooligosaccharide porter (Maltose is not a substrate, but maltotriose is.)","2":"PBDID: 1ELJ"},{"0":"3.A.1.1.22","1":"The maltose, maltotriose, mannotetraose (MalE1)\/maltose, maltotriose, trehalose (MalE2) porter (Nanavati et al., 2005).

The transporter forms a transmembrane channel that is sufficiently wide to accommodate a linear polysaccharide. Its nucleotide-binding domain and a periplasmic extension form 'gate helices' at the cytosolic and periplasmic membrane interfaces that probably serve as substrate entry and exit points (Bi et al. 2018). O antigen structures are serotype specific and form extended cell surface barriers endowing many pathogens with survival benefits. In the ABC transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathway, O antigens are assembled on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane on a lipid anchor and reoriented to the periplasmic leaflet by WzmWzt for ligation to the core lipopolysaccharides. This process depends on the chemical modification of the O antigen's nonreducing terminus, sensed by WzmWzt via a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) that extends its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Caffalette and Zimmer 2021 provided the cryoEM structure of this full-length WzmWzt transporter bound to ATP in a lipid environment, revealing a highly asymmetric transporter organization. The CBDs dimerize and associate with only one NBD. Conserved loops at the CBD dimer interface straddle a conserved peripheral NBD helix. The CBD dimer is oriented perpendicularly to the NBDs and its putative ligand-binding sites face the transporter to likely modulate ATPase activity upon O antigen binding. A closed WzmWzt conformation in which an aromatic belt near the periplasmic channel exit seals the transporter in a resting, ATP-bound state.

Four x-ray structures, trapped in different conformations, two with and two without nucleotide, have been solved (Ward et al., 2007). They suggest an alternating accessibility mode of transport with major conformational changes. The mechanism and conformational transitions have been discussed (Moradi and Tajkhorshid 2013). MsbA is energized both by ATP hydrolysis and the H+ electrochemical gradient (Singh et al. 2016). Mi et al. 2017 used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structures of lipid-nanodisc-embedded MsbA in three functional states. The 4.2 \u00c5-resolution structure of the transmembrane domains of nucleotide-free MsbA revealed that LPS binds deeply inside MsbA at the height of the periplasmic leaflet. Two sub-nanometre-resolution structures of MsbA with ADP-vanadate and ADP revealed a closed and an inward-facing conformation, respectively. A 2.9 A resolution structure of MsbA in complex with G907, a selective small-molecule antagonist with bactericidal activity, revealed an unanticipated mechanism of ABC transporter inhibition. G907 traps MsbA in an inward-facing, lipopolysaccharide-bound conformation by wedging into an architecturally conserved transmembrane pocket. A second allosteric mechanism of antagonism occurs through structural and functional uncoupling of the nucleotide-binding domains (Ho et al. 2018). Coupled ATPase-adenylate kinase activity in ABC transporters including MsbA has been demonstrated (Kaur et al. 2016). Close-proximity effects and structural coupling of the transmembrane domains with the NBDs has been suggested (Josts et al. 2019). Two first-generation inhibitors of MsbA, TBT1 and G247, induce opposite effects on ATP hydrolysis. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays, TBT1 and G247 were found to bind adjacent yet separate pockets in the MsbA transmembrane domains (Th\u00e9lot et al. 2021).

PglK may employ a \"substrate-hunting\" mechanism to locally increase the LLO concentration and facilitate its jump into the translocation pathway, for which sugars from the LLO head group are essential; the release of LLO to the outside occurs before ATP hydrolysis and is followed by the closing of the periplasmic cavity of PglK (Perez et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 5c73  PBDID: 5NBD"},{"0":"3.A.1.106.18","1":"Peptide and multidrug resistance porter of the ABC superfamily, TmrAB.

The system has been found to export the dye, hoechst 33342, and to be inhibited by verapamil (Zutz et al. 2011). The subnanometre-resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy has been solved (Kim et al. 2015). A cavity in the transmembrane domain is accessible laterally from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane as well as from the cytoplasm, indicating that the transporter lies in an inward-facing open conformation. The two nucleotide-binding domains remain in contact via their carboxy-terminal helices. Comparison between this structure and those of other ABC transporters suggests a possible trajectory of conformational changes that involves a sliding and rotating motion between the two nucleotide-binding domains during the transition from the inward-facing to outward-facing conformations (Kim et al. 2015). A subset of annular lipids is normally invariant in composition, with negatively charged lipids binding tightly to TmrAB, suggesting that this exporter may be involved in glycolipid translocation (Bechara et al. 2015). Coupled ATPase-adenylate kinase activity in ABC transporters including TmrAB has been demonstrated (Kaur et al. 2016). A 2.7-\u00c5 X-ray structure of TmrAB has been determined. It not only shares structural homology with the antigen translocation complex TAP, but is also able to restore antigen processing in human TAP-deficient cells. TmrAB exhibits a broad peptide specificity and can concentrate substrates several thousandfold, using only one single active ATP-binding site. It  adopts an asymmetric inward-facing state, and the C-terminal helices, arranged in a zipper-like fashion, play a role in guiding the conformational changes associated with substrate transport (N\u00f6ll et al. 2017). Conformational coupling and trans-inhibition have been characterized (Barth et al. 2018), and a conserved motif in intracellular loop 1 stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of TmrAB (Millan et al. 2021). A strong entropy-enthalpy compensation mechanism enables the closure of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) over a wide temperature range.

ATP binding alternates access to the transmembrane pathway and reglates protease activity (Lin et al. 2015). Subunit asymmetry of the M3-M4 loops contribute to optimizing AChR activation through allosteric links to the channel and the agonist binding site (Shen et al. 2005). Structures were more recently determined in the absence and presence of ATP, revealing how ATP binding regulates the protease activity and access to the translocation pathway. Two substrate CtAs, 90-residue polypeptides, are bound via their N-terminal leader peptides, but only one is positioned for cleavage and translocation. The structures were determined in the absence and presence of ATP, revealing how ATP binding regulates the protease activity and access to the translocation pathway. It seems that substrate cleavage, ATP hydrolysis, and substrate translocation are coordinated in a transport cycle (Kieuvongngam et al. 2020). The N-terminal C39 peptidase (PEP) domain of PCAT1 processes its natural substrate, CtA, by cleaving a conserved -GG- motif to separate the cargo from the leader peptide prior to secretion.

ATP hydrolysis occurs at the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) dimer interface, whereas substrate translocation takes place at the translocation pathway between the TM subunits, which is more than 30 angstroms away from the NBD dimer interface. Hydrolysis of ATP appears to facilitate substrate translocation by opening the cytoplasmic end of translocation pathway (Pan et al. 2016). The molecular mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by BtuCD-F may proceeds in a stepwise manner (Prie\u00df et al. 2018). First, nucleophilic attack of an activated lytic water molecule at the ATP gamma-phosphate yields ADP + HPO42-. A conserved glutamate located close to the gamma-phosphate transiently accepts a proton acting as a catalytic base. In the second step, the proton transfers back from the catalytic base to the gamma-phosphate, yielding ADP + H2PO4-. These two reaction steps are followed by rearrangements of the hydrogen bond network and the coordination of the Mg2+ ion. The overall free energy change of the reaction is close to zero, suggesting that ATP binding is essential for tight dimerization of the nucleotide-binding domains and the transition of the transmembrane domains from inward- to outward-facing. ATP hydrolysis resets the conformational cycle (Prie\u00df et al. 2018).","2":"PBDID: 1L7V  PBDID: 2QI9  PBDID: 4DBL  PBDID: 4FI3  PBDID: 4R9U  PBDID: 1L7V  PBDID: 2QI9  PBDID: 4DBL  PBDID: 4FI3  PBDID: 4R9U"},{"0":"3.A.1.135.5","1":"The hetrodimeric ABC transporter, TM287\/TM288.

LptB2FG extracts LPSs from the IM and transports them to the outer membrane.\u00a0Luo et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG from P. aeruginosa.  It shows that LPS transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a TM domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is  expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction  by LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (Luo et al. 2017). LptB2FG extracts LPS from the periplasmic face of the IM through a pair of lateral gates and then powers transperiplasmic transport to the OM through a slide formed by either of the periplasmic domains of LptF or LptG, LptC, LptA and the N-terminal domain of LptD. The structural and functional studies of the seven lipopolysaccharide transport proteins provide a platform to explore the unusual mechanisms of LPS extraction, transport and insertion from the inner membrane to the outer membrane (Dong et al. 2017).

Pgp also exports immunosuppressants, detergents, long-chain fatty acids, HIV protease inhibitors, synthetic tetramethylrosamine analogues, calcein M, etc.); it is also a peptide efflux pump, and peptide inhibitors have been designed (Tarasova et al. 2005). It is also a phospholipid (e.g., phosphatidyl serine), cholesterol and sterol flippase. It binds and probably transports inhibitors and agonists of SUR (3.A.1.208.4) (Bessadok et al., 2011). Modulatory effects of inhibitory amlodipine and tamoxifen on P-glycoprotein efflux activities have been studied (Darvari and Boroujerdi 2004). The 3-d structure has been determined (Aller et al., 2009). It can pump from the cytoplasmic leaflet to either the outer leaflet or the outer medium (Katzir et al., 2010).

Berberine, palmatine, jateorhizine, cetirizine and coptisine are all P-gp substrates, and cyclosporin A and verapamil are potent inhibitors (He et al. 2010; Zhang et al., 2011). Transports clarithromycin (CAM), a macrolide antibiotic used to treat lung infections, more effectively than azithromycin (AZM) or telithromycin (TEL) (Togami et al. 2012). Nucleotides, lipids and drugs bind synergistically to the pump (Marcoux et al. 2013). Fluorescent substrates have been identified (Strouse et al. 2013). The central cavity undergoes alternating access during ATP hydrolysis (van Wonderen et al. 2014). Structural data suggest that signals are transduced through intracellular loops of the TMSs that slot into grooves on the NBDs. The Q loops at the base of these grooves are required to couple drug binding to the ATP catalytic cycle of drug export (Zolnerciks et al. 2014). Ocotillol analogues are strong competitive inhibitors (Zhang et al. 2015). Durmus et al. 2015 have reviewed PGP transport of cancer chemotheraputic agents. ABCB1 variants modulate therapeutic responses to modafinil and may partly explain pharmacoresistance in Narcolepse type 1 (NT1) patients (Moresco et al. 2016). Many inhibitors have been identified (Hemmer et al. 2015). The open-and-close motion of the protein alters the surface topology of P-gp within the drug-binding pocket, explaining its polyspecificity (Esser et al. 2016). The ATP- and substrate-coupled conformational cycle of the mouse Pgp transporter have been defined, showing that the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is harnessed in the NBDs in a two-stroke cycle (Verhalen et al. 2017). Rilpivirine inhibits MDR1- and BCRP-mediated efflux of abacavir and increases its transmembrane transport (Reznicek et al. 2017). It transports Huerzine A in the brain, a drug that is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (Li et al. 2017). AbcB1 acts in concert with ABCA1, ABCG2 and ABCG4 to efflux amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kuai et al. 2018).The structure has been determined with\u00a0the ABCB1 inhibitor, zosuquidar, bound. This structure reveals the transporter in an occluded conformation with a central, enclosed, inhibitor-binding pocket lined by residues from all TMSs. The pocket spans almost the entire width of the lipid membrane and is occupied exclusively by two closely interacting zosuquidar molecules (Alam et al. 2018). Iit is also inhibited by dacomitinib (Fan et al. 2018). Moreover, Kim and Chen 2018 presented the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing conformation, determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.4-\u00c5 resolution. The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer occluding two ATP molecules. The drug-binding cavity observed in the inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space and is compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates  that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release (Kim and Chen 2018). P-gp also transports opioid peptides (Ganapathy and Miyauchi 2005). MDR1 has been quantified in primary human renal cell carcinoma cells and corresponding normal tissue, and down-regulation or expression loss was documented in tumor tissues, corroborating its importance in drug resistance and efficacy (Poetz et al. 2018). Regarding the conformational transitions, first the transition is driven by the NBDs, then transmitted to the cytoplasmic parts of TMSs, and finally to the periplasmic parts. The trajectories show that besides the translational motions, the NBDs undergo a rotation movement (Zhang et al. 2018). Isoxanthohumol is a substrate and competitive inhibitor which reverses ABCB1-mediated doxorubicin resistance (Liu et al. 2017). Tariquidar is a potent inhibitor, even when taken orally (Matzneller et al. 2018). Combined oral administration of the ovarian hormones, ethinyl estradiol and progesterone, significantly lowered both MDR-1 mRNA and MDR-1 protein in the ovary (Brayboy et al. 2018). Its expression in immune cells plays a protective role from xenobiotics and toxins (Bossennec et al. 2018). Oxypeucedanin reverses P-gp-mediated drug transport by inhibition of P-gp activity and P-gp protein expression as well as downregulation of P-gp mRNA levels (Dong et al. 2018). Alam et al. 2019\u00a0determined the 3.5-\u00c5 cryo-EM structure of substrate-bound human ABCB1 reconstituted in lipidic nanodiscs, revealing a single molecule of the chemotherapeutic compound paclitaxel (Taxol) bound in a central, occluded pocket. A second structure of inhibited, human-mouse chimeric ABCB1 revealed two molecules of zosuquidar occupying the same drug-binding pocket. Minor structural differences between substrate- and inhibitor-bound ABCB1 sites are amplified toward the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), revealing how the plasticity of the drug-binding site controls the dynamics of the ATP-hydrolyzing NBDs. Ordered cholesterol and phospholipid molecules suggest how the membrane modulates the conformational changes associated with drug binding and transport (Alam et al. 2019). The TMS4\/6 cleft may be an energetically favorable entrance gate for ligand entry into the binding pocket of P-gp (Xing et al. 2019). The epigallocatechin gallate derivative Y6 reverses drug resistance mediated by ABCB1 (Wen et al. 2019). Substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites, but this state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites (Dastvan et al. 2019). It transports temozolomide (TMZ) which is used as a treatment of glioblasomas (Malmstr\u00f6m et al. 2019). Unconventional cholesterol translocation on the surface of Pgp provides a secondary transport model for the known flippase activity of ABC exporters of cholesterol (Thangapandian et al. 2020). An in silico multiclass classification model capable of predicting the probability of a compound to interact with P-gp has been developed using a counter-propagation artificial neural network (CP ANN) based on a set of 2D molecular descriptors, as well as an extensive dataset of 2512 compounds (1178 P-gp inhibitors, 477 P-gp substrates and 857 P-gp non-active compounds) (Mora Lagares et al. 2019). Jervine is a natural teratogenic compound isolated from Veratrum californicum.\u00a0Liu et al. 2019 showed that jervine sensitizes the anti-proliferation effect of doxorubicin (DOX) and that the synergistic mechanism was related to the intracellular accumulation of DOX via modulating ABCB1 transport. Jervine did not affect the expression of ABCB1 in mRNA or protein levels. However, jervine increased the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and probably served as a substrate of ABCB1. Jervine binds to a closed ABCB1 conformation and blocks drug entrance to the central binding site at the transmembrane domain (Liu et al. 2019). 6-Triazolyl-substituted sulfocoumarins inhibit P-gp (Podolski-Reni\u00c4\u0087 et al. 2019). ATP binding causes the conformational change to the outward-facing state, and ATP hydrolysis and subsequent release of \u03b3-phosphate from both NBDs allow the outward-facing state to return to the original inward-facing state (Futamata et al. 2020). Replacing the eleven native tryptophans by directed evolution produces an active P-glycoprotein with site-specific, non-conservative substitutions (Swartz et al. 2020). ABCB1 polymorphisms alter P-gp-mediated drug (sunitinib) sensitivities. Homology modeling provided insight into ligand binding through molecular docking studies (Mora Lagares et al. 2020). Sitravatinib reverses MDR mediated by ABCB1 and partially antagonized ABCC10-mediated MDR (Yang et al. 2020). Apiole from parsley blocks the active P-gp site, with strong binding energy, which, in turn, inhibits doxorubicin and vincristine efflux, increasing the antiproliferative response of these chemotherapeutic agents (Afonso de Lima et al. 2020). The mechanisms of action of synthetic, potent, small molecule P-gp inhibitors have been reviewed (Zhang et al. 2020). ATP binding to the open NBDs and ATP hydrolysis in the closed NBD dimer represent two steps of energy input, each leading to the formation of a high energy state. Relaxation from these high energy states occurs through conformational changes that push ABCB1 through the transport cycle (Sz\u00f6ll\u00c5\u0091si et al. 2020). 14 conserved residues (seven in both TMsSs 6 and 12) were substituted with alanine and generated a mutant termed 14A (Sajid et al. 2020). Although the 14A mutant lost the ability to pump most of the substrates tested out of cancer cells, it was able to import four substrates, including rhodamine 123 (Rh123) and the taxol derivative flutax-1. Similar to the efflux function of wild-type P-gp, uptake was ATP hydrolysis-, substrate concentration-, and time-dependent. Further mutagenesis identified residues in both TMSs 6 and 12 that synergistically form a switch in the central region of the two helices that governs whether a given substrate is pumped out of or into the cell (Sajid et al. 2020). Helix repacking may be the basis for P-glycoprotein promiscuity (Bonito et al. 2020). The use of carbon nano-onion-mediated dual targeting of P-selectin and P-glycoprotein has been shown to overcome cancer drug resistance (Wang et al. 2021). A sequentially responsive Nnanosystem breaches cascaded bio-barriers and suppresses P-Glycoprotein function for reversing cancer drug resistance (Liu et al. 2020). Lys-268 and the cytoplasmic end of TMS5 may comprise a drug binding site (Demmer et al. 2021). MDR1 protein (ABC-C1) is overexpressed in Giardia intestinalis following incubation with the drugs, albendazole and nitazoxanide (\u00c1ngeles-Arvizu et al. 2021). The human P-gp is inhibited by benzophenone sulfonamide derivatives (Farman et al. 2020) and androstano-arylpyrimidines (Gopisetty et al. 2021), and possibly by tepoxalin (McQuerry et al. 2021). The inward facing state of P-glycoprotein in a lipid membrane has been confirmed (Carey Hulyer et al. 2020). For transmembrane pharmaceutical drug transport, non-specific trans-phospholipid bilayer transport may be negligible (Kell 2021). Glabratephrin reverses doxorubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (Abd-Ellatef et al. 2021). In silico screening of c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting nucleotide and drug-substrate binding sites of ABCB1 are potential MDR reversal agents (Moosavi et al. 2022). Quercetin acts as a P-gp modulator via impeding signal transduction from the nucleotide-binding domain to the transmembrane domain (Singh et al. 2022). MDR1 promotes intrinsic and acquired resistance to PROTACs in cancer cells and exports the antiseizure drug, levetiracetam (Behmard et al. 2022). Air pollution exposure increases ABCB1 and ASCT1 transporter levels in mouse cortex (Puris et al. 2022). MDR-1 dysfunction perturbs meiosis and Ca2+ homeostasis in oocytes (Nabi et al. 2022). The P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter has been modelled with in silico methods (Mora Lagares and Novi\u00c4\u008d 2022).","2":"PBDID: 6C0V  PBDID: 6FN1  PBDID: 6FN4  PBDID: 6QEX"},{"0":"3.A.1.201.14","1":"P-glycoprotein-1 MDR exporter.

The outward opening motion is required for ATP hydrolysis. Kodan et al. 2019 have reported a pair of structures of this homodimeric P-glycoprotein: an outward-facing conformational state with bound nucleotide, and an inward-facing apo state, at resolutions of 1.9\u00a0\u00c5 and 3.0 \u00c5, respectively. Features that can be clearly visualized include ATP binding with octahedral coordination of Mg2+; an inner chamber that significantly changes in volume with the aid of tight connections among TMSs 1, 3, and 6; a glutamate-arginine interaction that stabilizes the outward-facing conformation; and extensive interactions between TMS1 and TMS3, a property that distinguishes multidrug transporters from floppases (Kodan et al. 2019). The crystal structure of the CmABCB1 G132V mutant, which favors the outward-facing state, reveals the mechanism of the pivotal joint between TMS1 and TMS3 (Matsuoka et al. 2021).

It is associated with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) (Degiorgio et al. 2007) and progressive intrafamilial hepatic disease (Quazi and Molday, 2011)). ABCB4 exhibits narrow drug specificity relative to MDR1 but exports digoxin, paclitaxel, vinblastin and bile acids. It regulates phosphatidylcholine secretion into bile and its translocation across the plasma membrane in hepatocytes (Voloshyna and Reiss, 2011; Kluth et al. 2014) and functions as a floppase (Sakamoto et al. 2019). The cryo-EM structure trapped in an ATP-bound state at a resolution of 3.2 \u00c5 has been described (Olsen et al. 2019). The nucleotide binding domains form a closed conformation containing two bound ATP molecules, but only one of the ATPase sites contains bound Mg2+. The transmembrane domains adopt a collapsed conformation at the level of the lipid bilayer, but a large, hydrophilic and fully occluded cavity at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane boundary, with no ligand bound is present. This indicates a state following substrate release but prior to ATP hydrolysis. These results rationalize disease-causing mutations in human ABCB4 and suggest an 'alternating access' mechanism of lipid extrusion, distinct from the 'credit card swipe' model of other lipid transporters (Olsen et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 6S7P"},{"0":"3.A.1.202.1","1":"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (also called ABCC7); cyclic AMP-dependent chloride channel; also catalyzes nucleotide (ATP-ADP)-dependent glutathione and glutathione-conjugate flux (Kogan et al., 2003) (may also activate inward rectifying K+ channels). The underlying mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis controls channel opening is described by Gadsby et al., 2006. The most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is defective folding of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutant lacking Phe508 (DeltaF508)(Riordan, 2008). The DeltaF508 protein appears to be trapped in a prefolded state with incomplete packing of the transmembrane segments, a defect that can be repaired by direct interaction with correctors such as corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532 (Wang et al., 2007). CFTR interacts directly with MRP4 (3.A.1.208.7) to control Cl- secretion (Li et al., 2007). It has intrinsic adenylate kinase activity that may be of functional importance (Randak and Welsh, 2007). The intact CFTR protein mediates ATPase rather than adenylate kinase activity (Ramjeesingh et al., 2008). Regulated by Na+\/H+ exchange regulatory cofactors (NHERF; O14745; TC #8.A.24.1.1) (Seidler et al., 2009). Regulated by protein kinase A and C phosphorylation (Csan\u00e1dy et al., 2010). It is also activated by membrane stretch induced by negative pressures (Zhang et al., 2010). TMS6 plays roles in gating and permeation (Bai et al., 2010; 2011). The 3-D structure revealed the probable location of the channel gate (Rosenberg et al., 2011). Conformational changes opening the CFTR chloride channel pore, coupled to ATP-dependent gating, have been studied (Wang and Linsdell, 2012). Alternating access to the transmembrane domain of CFTR has been demonstrated (Wang and Linsdell, 2012).\u00a0MRP4 and CFTR function in the regulation of cAMP and beta-adrenergic contraction in cardiac myocytes (Sellers et al., 2012).

Small molecule CFTR potentiators and correctors that overcome the efects of deleterious mutations have been identified (Kym et al. 2018).

The structure, gating and regulation of the CFTR anion channel has been reviewed (Csan\u00e1dy et al. 2019). Mutants impairing ion conductance giving rise to CF, are partially corrected using the drug ivacaftor, and the structure of CFTR bound to this drug, which keeps the channel open has been solved by cryoEM (Liu et al. 2019).

Functions at the blood:placenta barrier of the mouse (Kumar et al. 2016). The Q141K variant exhibits decreased functional expression and thus increased drug accumulation and decreased urate secretion, and the R482 position, which plays a role the substrate specificity, is located in one of the substrate binding pockets (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 et al. 2016). Naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms in humans giving rise to amino acyl residue substitutions in the transmembrane domains result in impared transport of Lucifer Yellow and estrone sulfate (Sj\u00f6stedt et al. 2017). A cryoEM structure revealed two cholesterol molecules bound in the multidrug-binding pocket that is located in a central, hydrophobic, inward-facing translocation pathway between TMSs. A multidrug recognition and transport mechanism was proposed, and disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms were rationalized. The structural basis of cholesterol recognition by G-subfamily ABC transporters was also revealed (Taylor et al. 2017). Catalyzes efflux of ochratoxin A (OTA) (Qi et al. 2017).

ABCG2 acts in concert with ABCA1, ABCB1 and ABCG4 to efflux amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kuai et al. 2018). Inhibited by dacomitinib (Fan et al. 2018). A specific inhibitor, CCTA-1523, is a potent, selective and reversible modulator of ABCG2 (Patel et al. 2017). Exports uric acid (urate), and its loss promotes onset of hyperuricemia. It has potential as a regulator of Gout (Fujita and Ichida 2018). High resolution cryo-EM structures of human ABCG2 bound to synthetic derivatives of the fumitremorgin C-related inhibitor Ko143 or the multidrug resistance modulator tariquidar have been solved (Jackson et al. 2018). Both compounds are bound to the central, inward-facing cavity of ABCG2, blocking access for substrates and preventing conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis. The high resolutions allowed for de novo building of the entire transporter and also revealed tightly bound phospholipids and cholesterol interacting with the lipid-exposed surface of the TMSs (Jackson et al. 2018). Multiple drug binding pockets and residues involved in binding have been identified (Cox et al. 2018). The third transmembrane helix and adjacent regions of ABCG2 may interact with AT1 receptor antagonists, giving rise to drug-drug interactions in multi-drug regimens (Ripperger et al. 2018). The system is inhibitied by hetero aryl phenyl inhititors (K\u00f6hler et al. 2018). It is present in the blood-brain, blood-testis and maternal-fetal barriers, and cryoEM of a mutant shows the protein in a substrate-bound pre-translocation state and an ATP-bound post-translocation state (Manolaridis et al. 2018). A single molecule of estrone-3-sulfate (E1S) is bound in a central, hydrophobic, cytoplasm-facing cavity about halfway across the membrane. Only one molecule of E1S can bind in the observed binding mode. In the ATP-bound state, the substrate-binding cavity has collapsed while an external cavity has opened to the extracellular side of the membrane. The ATP-induced conformational changes include rigid-body shifts of the transmembrane domains, pivoting of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a change in the relative orientation of the NBD subdomains (Manolaridis et al. 2018). This shows how the energy of ATP binding extrudes E1S and other substrates, and suggests that the size and binding affinity of compounds are important for distinguishing substrates from inhibitors. Its structure, mechanism and inhibitory propensity have been reviewed (Kapoor et al. 2018). Y6, an Epigallocatechin Gallate Derivative, Reverses ABCG2-Mediated Mitoxantrone Resistance (Zhao et al. 2018). ABCG2 confers resistance to several cancer treatments. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anti-cancer method involving the use of light-activated photosensitisers to induce oxidative stress and cell death in cancers, but ABCG2 can efflux photosensitisers (Khot et al. 2019). Regorafenib sensitized MDR colon cancer cells to BCRP substrates by increasing intracellular accumulation without changes in the expression level or the subcellular distribution of BCRP in the cells exposed to regorafenib. Regorafenib stimulates BCRP ATPase activity and promotes a stable interaction between regorafenib and the transmembrane domain of BCRP (Zhang et al. 2019). Several potent inhibitors, effective in the millimicromolar range have been identified (Zou et al. 2020). Licochalcone A selectively resensitizes ABCG2-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (Wu et al. 2020). The GXXXG motif promotes proper packing of the TMSs in the functional ABCG2 homodimer (Polgar et al. 2004). Molecular dynamics simulations have provided insight into the steps of the substrate transport process and its regulation by cholesterol (Nagy et al. 2020). Drug binding cavities other than the central binding site as well as a putative dynamic transport pathway for substrates with variable structures have been revealed. Membrane cholesterol accelerated drug transport by promoting the closure of cytoplasmic protein regions. ABCG2 is present in all major biological barriers and drug-metabolizing organs, influences the pharmacokinetics of numerous clinically applied drugs, and plays a key role in uric acid extrusion (Nagy et al. 2020). The first intracellular loop is essential for the catalytic cycle (Khunweeraphong and Kuchler 2020). While all other human ABCG transporters are specific for lipids, ABCG2 has a network of residues that may confer extra conformational flexibility, enabling it to transport a wider array of substrates (Mitchell-White et al. 2021). VKNG-1, an inhibitor of ABCG2, may, in combination with certain anticancer drugs, provide a treatment to overcome ABCG2-mediated MDR colon cancers (Narayanan et al. 2021). Sophoraflavanone (SFG) may be an effective inhibitor of ABCG2 to improve the efficacy of therapeutic drugs in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Wu et al. 2021).

Cholesteryl oleate, phosphatidyl choline and enantiomeric cholesterol are poorly transported (mutation of either ABCG5 or ABCG8 cause sitosterolemia and coronary atherosclerosis) (Zhang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006; 2011).\u00a0It is involved in cell signalling, creation of membrane asymmetry and apoptosis (Quazi and Molday, 2011). The ABCG5\/ABCG8 heterodimer (G5G8) mediates excretion of neutral sterols as well as the drug, Marinobufagenin, a Na+\/K+-ATPase inhibitor, in the liver and intestine (Lan et al. 2018). Mutations disrupting G5G8 cause sitosterolaemia, a disorder characterized by sterol accumulation and premature atherosclerosis. Lee et al. 2016 used crystallization in lipid bilayers to determine the X-ray structure in a nucleotide-free state at 3.9 \u00c5 resolution. The structure revealed a new transmembrane fold that is present in a large and functionally diverse superfamily of ABC transporters. The transmembrane domains are coupled to the nucleotide-binding sites by networks of interactions that differ between the active and inactive ATPases, reflecting the catalytic asymmetry of the transporter (Lee et al. 2016). High expression levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 were observed in liver, the digestive tract and the mammary gland. The system plays roles in lipid and sterol intestinal absorption, biliary excretion, and lipid trafficking and excretion during lactation (Viturro et al. 2006). ABCG5\/G8 is active in the excretion of cholesterol and sterols into bile (vanBerge-Henegouwen et al. 2004). Disruption of the unique ABCG-family NBD:NBD interface impacts both drug transport and ATP hydrolysis (Kapoor et al. 2020). Transmembrane polar relay drives the allosteric regulation for the ABCG5\/G8 sterol transporter (Xavier et al. 2020). Rare mutations can give rise to tendon xanthoma along with tendosynovitis (Wadsack et al. 2018). ABCG5\/8 mediates secretion of neutral sterols into bile and the gut lumen, whereas G1 (TC# 3.A.1.204.12) transports cholesterol from macrophages to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Cryo-EM structures of human G5G8 in sterol-bound and human G1 in cholesterol- and ATP-bound states have been solved. Both transporters have a sterol-binding site that is accessible from the cytosolic leaflet. A second site is present midway through the transmembrane domains of ABCG5\/G8. The Walker A motif of G8 adopts a unique conformation that accounts for the marked asymmetry in ATPase activities between the two nucleotide-binding sites of G5G8 (Sun et al. 2021).

They serve as sequence signatures to differentiate ABCG5\/ABCG8 from other ABCG subfamily proteins, and some of them may contribute to substrate specificity of the ABCG5\/ABCG8 transporter (Pei and Cong 2022). Structural analysis of cholesterol binding and sterol selectivity by ABCG5\/G8 have been reported (Farhat et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 5do7  PBDID: 5do7"},{"0":"3.A.1.208.10","1":"Multidrug (anthracycline) resistance organic anion efflux pump (ABCC6; ABC-C6; MRP6; MOAT-E) - the ectopic mineralization disorder, pseudoxanthoma elasticum disease (PXE), protein (Vanakker et al. 2013; Rasmussen et al. 2013). It exports glutathione metal conjugates as well as leukotriene C4, DNP, and N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione, and also exports anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, cisplatin, and probably probenecid, benzbromarone and indomethacin (Chen and Tiwari, 2011). The system participates in networds of complex diseases (De Vilder et al. 2015). This transporter has an extra N-terminal domain (TMD0) and a loop, L0. TMD0 is not required for transport function, but L0 maintains ABCC6 in a targeting-competent state for the basolateral membranes of liver and kidney cells and might be involved in regulating the NBDs (Miglionico et al. 2016). PXE is a disease of altered elastic properties in multiple tissues. Many of these mutations influence various steps in the biosynthetic pathway, minimally altering local domain structure but adversely impacting ABCC6 assembly and trafficking (Ran and Thibodeau 2016). PXE is an ectopic, metabolic mineralization disorder that affects the skin, eye, and vessels. ABCC6 is assumed to mediate efflux of one or several small molecule compounds from the liver cytosol to the circulation. In mice, abrogating ABCC6 function causes alterations in the liver metabolic profile, suggesting that PXE is a metabolic disease originating from a liver disturbance (Rasmussen et al. 2016). Thus, MRP6 is involved in the regulation of tissue calcification in mammals, and mutations are associated with human ectopic calcification disorders. Comparative analyses of ABCC6 and ABCC1 from invertebrates to vertebrates revealed a bony endoskeleton first evolved with ABCC1, while the ABCC6 gene is only found in bony vertebrate genomes (Parreira et al. 2018). Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a heritable multi-system ectopic mineralization disorder, is caused by inactivating mutations in the ABCC6 gene. The encoded protein has a specialized efflux function in hepatocytes by contributing to plasma levels of PPi, a potent inhibitor of mineralization in soft connective tissues. Reduced plasma PPi levels underlie the ectopic mineralization in PXE (Kowal et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 6BZR  PBDID: 6BZS  PBDID: 6NLO  PBDID: 6P7F"},{"0":"3.A.1.208.4","1":"SUR1 sulfonylurea receptor; subunit and regulator of \u03b1-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channel (TC #1.A.2); determines ATP sensitivity; no inherent transport function known; associated with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia (also called ABCC8). Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) cause neonatal diabetes mellitus. Because mutant channels are inhibited less strongly by MgATP, this increases K(ATP) currents in pancreatic beta cells, thus reducing insulin secretion and producing diabetes (de Wet et al., 2007). Binds ligands (blockers): glibenclamide, tolbutamide, and meglitinide as well as agonists, SR47063 (a cromakalim analog), P1075 (a pinacidil analog), and diazoxide (Bessadok et al., 2011).\u00a0ATP activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels composed of mutant sulfonylurea receptor 1 and Kir6.2 with diminished PIP2 sensitivity (Pratt and Shyng, 2011).\u00a0Dominant missense mutations in ABCC9, promoting open channel formation, cause Cant\u00fa syndrome (Harakalova et al., 2012; van Bon et al., 2012). The N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1 controls gating of Kir6.2 by modulating channel sensitivity to PIP2 (Pratt et al., 2011). Familial mild hyperglycemia is due to the ABCC8-V84I mutation (Gonsorcikova et al., 2011). ATP regulates KATP channels by promoting dimerization and conformational switching (Ortiz et al. 2013). Mutations causing neonatal diabetes are attributed to alterations in the affinites for ATP and ADP (Ortiz and Bryan 2015). Two groups of mutations with different cellular mechanisms have been identified. 1) Channel complexes with mutations in NBD2 of SUR1 traffic normally but are unable to be activated by MgADP. 2) Channel mutations in the TMS domains of SUR1 are retained in the ER and have variable functional impairment (Nessa et al. 2015). KATP channels (Kir6.2\/SUR1) in the brain and endocrine pancreas couple metabolic status to the membrane potential. In beta-cells, increases in cytosolic [ATP\/ADP] inhibit KATP channel activity, leading to membrane depolarization and exocytosis of insulin granules. Mutations in ABCC8 (SUR1) or KCNJ11 (Kir6.2) can result in gain or loss of channel activity and cause neonatal diabetes (ND) or congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), respectively. Nucleotide binding without hydrolysis switches SUR1 to stimulatory conformations. Increased affinity for ATP gives rise to ND while decreased affinty gives rise to CHI (Ortiz and Bryan 2015). SUR1 mutations constitute a genetic aetiology for neonatal diabetes, and they act by reducing the KATP channel's ATP sensitivity (Proks et al. 2006). Polymorphic ABCC8 isoforms are key regulatory proteins of cerebral oedema in many neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury (Jha et al. 2018). In polymorphisms predictive of oedema, variant alleles\/genotypes confer increased risk while different variant polymorphisms are associated with favourable outcome, potentially suggesting distinct mechanisms (Jha et al. 2018). KATP channels are energy sensors that are clinically validated drug targets. KATP inhibitors are prescribed for diabetes and KATP activators are used for the treatment of hypoglycemia, hypertension, and hair loss. Wu et al., 2022 [PMID 36253099] highlight the current knowledge about the drug binding modes observed using cryogenic EM. The inhibitors and activators bind to two distinct sites in the transmembrane domain of the SUR subunit. These drugs allosterically modulate the dimerization of SUR nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and thus KATP channel activity (Wu et al., 2022 [PMID 36253099]).","2":"PBDID: 6C3O  PBDID: 6C3P"},{"0":"3.A.1.208.8","1":"Drug resistance pump; ABCC1 (MRP1), exports chemotherapeutic agents, organic anions such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4), 17-\u03b2-estradiol 17-\u03b2-D-glucuronide, glucuronide-X (E217\u03b2G, etoposide-glucuronide), estrone-3-sulfate, folic acid and methotrexate, arsenic triglutathione, arsenic and antimonial oxyanions, glutathione (GSH), GSSG, glutathione conjugates (GSH-X; LTC4, DNP-SG, EA-SG, NEH-SG), sulfate-X (E1S, DHEAS), HIV protease inhibitors, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and Vinca alkaloids.

Notch1 regulates the expression in cultured cancer cells (Cho et al., 2011). Structural and functional properties of MRP1 have been reviewed comprehensively (He et al. 2011). Fluorescent substrates have been identified (Strouse et al. 2013). It pumps out sulfur mustards and nitrogen mustards (mechlorethamine, HN2), potent vesicants developed as chemical warfare agents (Udasin et al. 2015). It has 3 membrane domains with a total of 17 TMSs. Loss of the aromatic side chain at position 583 impairs the release of ADP and thus effectively locks the transporter in a low-affinity solute binding state (Weigl et al. 2018). MRP1 Tyr1189 and Tyr1190, unlike the corresponding residues in SUR1, are not involved in its differential sensitivity to sulfonylureas, but nevertheless, may be involved in the transport activity of MRP1, especially with respect to glutathione, GSH (Conseil et al. 2005). Modulators of MRP1 activity have been found (M\u00f6hle et al. 2020). Glu1204 serves a dual role in membrane expression of MRP1 and in a step in its catalytic cycle subsequent to initial substrate binding (Situ et al. 2004). The cotransport mechanism of GSH with anticancer drugs by MRP1 has been examined (Zhao et al. 2020). The first cytoplasmic loop in the core structure of ABCC1 contains multiple amino acids essential for Its expression (Conseil and Cole 2021). Carboplatin, paclitaxel and topotecan bind specifically to Asn510 in transmembrane domain 1 of MRP1 (Haque et al. 2022).

TAP1 has 10 TMSs, 4 unique N-terminal TMSs and 6 TMSs that form the translocation pore with N- and C-termini in the cytosol (Schrodt et al., 2006). The TAP2 nucleotide binding site appears to be the main catalytic active site driving transport suggesting asymmetry in the transporter (Perria et al., 2006). The TAP complex shows strict coupling between peptide binding and ATP hydrolysis, revealing no basal ATPase activity in the absence of peptides (Herget et al., 2009). There are three binding sites on TAP1 for tapasis which interconnects TAP and MHC class I, promotes TAP stability and facilitates heterodimerization (Leonhardt et al. 2014). TAP is the target of GN1 (TC#8.B.25.1.1), a virally encoded protein inhibitor of viral peptide exposure on the cell surface (Verweij et al. 2008; Rufer et al. 2015). Tapasin (448 aas; O15533) stabilizes TAP2 (Papadopoulos and Momburg 2007). Tapasin is involved in the association of MHC class I with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and in the assembly of MHC class I with peptide (peptide loading). TAP plays a key role in the adaptive immune defense against infected or malignantly transformed cells by translocating proteasomal degradation products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. TAP transports peptides from 8 to 40 residues, including even branched or modified molecules, suggestive of structural flexibility of the substrate-binding pocket. The bound peptides in side-chains' mobility was strongly restricted at the ends of the peptide, whereas the central region was flexible. Peptides bind to TAP in an extended kinked structure, analogous to those bound to MHC class I proteins (Herget et al., 2011). TAP translocates proteasomal degradation products from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where these peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules by a macromolecular peptide-loading complex (PLC) and subsequently shuttled to the cell surface for inspection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As a central adapter protein, tapasin (O15533) (Li et al. 2000) recruits other components of the PLC at the N-terminal domains of TAP. The alpha6\/beta10-loop determines the nonsynonymous nucleotide binding of NBD1 and NBD2, whereas the switch region seems to play a critical role in regulating the functional cross-talk between the structural domains of TAP (Ehses et al. 2005). Koch et al. 2006 found that the N-terminal domains of human TAP1 and TAP2 independently bind to tapasin, thus providing two separate loading platforms for PLC assembly. Tapasin binding is dependent on the first N-terminal TMS of TAP1 and TAP2, demonstrating that these two helices contribute independently to the recruitment of tapasin and associated factors (Koch et al. 2006). The endoplasmic reticulum-resident human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein US6 (gpUS6) inhibits peptide translocation by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) to prevent loading of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. gpUS6 associates with preformed TAP1\/2 heterodimers (Halenius et al. 2006).","2":"PBDID: 1JJ7  PBDID: 5U1D  PBDID: 5U1D"},{"0":"3.A.1.210.1","1":"The mitochondrial iron transporter, ATM1.

Kinking of TMS 6 in the post-ATP hydrolysis state, stabilized by MgADPVO4, eliminates this cavity, precluding uptake of glutathione derivatives. The presence of this cavity during the transition from the inward-facing to outward-facing conformational states, and its absence in the reverse direction, provide a mechanism for enforcing the export directionality of transport by NaAtm1 (Fan et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 4MRN  PBDID: 4MRP  PBDID: 4MRR  PBDID: 4MRS  PBDID: 4MRV  PBDID: 6PAM  PBDID: 6PAN  PBDID: 6PAO  PBDID: 6PAQ  PBDID: 6PAR  PBDID: 6VQT  PBDID: 6VQU"},{"0":"3.A.1.210.6","1":"Mitochondrial outer membrane\/lysosome anionic porphyrin uptake half ABC transporter, ABCB6.

A slit-like substrate binding pocket may accommodate the planar shape of porphyrins, and the existence of a secondary cavity near the mitochondrial intermembrane space side may further facilitate substrate release. Song et al. 2021 determined the cryo-EM structures of nanodisc-reconstituted human ABCB6 trapped in an apo-state and an ATP-bound state at resolutions of 3.6 and 3.5 \u00c5, respectively.

It restrains the access of substrates in the inward-facing state and is removed by ATP-driven conformational changes. No ligand cavities were observed in the nucleotide-bound state, indicating a state following substrate release but prior to ATP hydrolysis.

It is a key gatekeeper catalyzing intracellular phospholipid and cholesterol transport (Orlowski et al. 2007). It interacts with the MEGF10 protein and is 95% identical to the mouse orthologue, 3.A.1.211.1. Cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages decreases in the presence of plasma obtained from humans and rats with mild hyperbilirubinemia. A direct effect of unconjugated bilirubin on cholesterol efflux was demonstrated and is associated with decreased ABCA1 protein expression (Wang et al. 2017). A cryoEM structure (4.1 \u00c5) revealed that the two transmembrane domains contact each other through a narrow interface in the intracellular leaflet of the membrane, and two extracellular domains of ABCA1 enclose an elongated hydrophobic tunnel. Structural mapping of dozens of disease-related mutations allowed potential interpretation of their diverse pathogenic mechanisms. Structure-based analyses suggested a plausible \"lateral access\" mechanism for ABCA1-mediated lipid export that may be distinct from the conventional alternating-access paradigm. ABCA1 acts in concert with ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCG4 to efflux amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kuai et al. 2018). One substrate of systems ABCA1, ABCB1 and ABCC1 is arsenate, where ABCC1 is most effective while ABCA1 and ABCB1 are less effective (Zhou et al. 2018). ABCA1 transports lipids and cholesterol to apolipoprotein E (APOE) (Castranio et al. 2018). Cholesterol binding to ABCA1 may interfere with ATP binding in both nucleotide-binding domains of the ABCA1 structure (Dergunov et al. 2018). Adiponectin, possibly acting through AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, plays a key role in promoting ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux (Hafiane et al. 2019). Reverse cholesterol transport or cholesterol efflux is part of an extensive plasma membranes remodelling process in spermatozoa that induces hyperactivated motility and is imperative for fertilization. Cholesterol efflux depends on high density lipoproteins (HDLs) that interact with transmembrane cholesterol transporters, such as ABCA1 and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI; TC# 9.B.39.1.3) (Bernecic et al. 2021). Smoking can influence the expression of the ABCA1 gene, thereby modulating lipid transport processes in macrophages, which are part of the mechanisms of inflammation development (Kotlyarov and Kotlyarova 2021). The cavity enclosed within the ATP-unbound form of ABCA1 is narrow at the distal ends of the TMD as well as the ECD region, substantiating the \"lateral access\" theory (Sunidhi et al. 2021). Curcumin ameliorates lipid metabolic disorder and cognitive dysfunction via ABCA1 (Tian et al. 2021). Insulin downregulates the expression of ABC A-I in human hepatoma cell line HepG2 in a FOXO1 and LXR-dependent manner (Shavva et al. 2022).

MlaA (VacJ) is a \"spreading\" protein, essential for Shigella\u00a0pathogenicity (Suzuki et al., 1994). The ABC transporter, MlaEFBD, provides energy for maintaining OM lipid asymmetry via the transport of aberrantly localized phospholipids (PLs) from the OM to the inner membrane (IM) (Thong et al. 2016). MlaD spans the periplasm, forms stable hexamers within the complex, functions in substrate binding with strong affinity for PLs within a channel that spans the periplasm, and modulates ATP hydrolytic activity. MlaB plays critical roles in both the assembly and activity of the transporter. MlaA forms a complex with OmpC and OmpF in the outer membrane to extract PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM (Chong et al. 2015). MlaA is a monomeric 2 \u03b1-helical TMS OM protein that functions as a phospholipid translocation channel, forming a ~20-\u00c5-thick doughnut embedded in the inner leaflet of the OM with a central, amphipathic pore (Abell\u00f3n-Ruiz et al. 2017). This architecture prevents access of inner leaflet phospholipids to the pore, but allows outer leaflet phospholipids to bind to a pronounced ridge surrounding the channel. Members of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family, one of which is MlaD, form hexameric assemblies with a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport across the periplasm (Ekiert et al. 2017). MlaD forms a ring associated with the ABC transporter complex in the inner membrane. A soluble lipid-binding protein, MlaC ferries lipids between MlaD and an outer membrane protein  complex. EM structures of two other E. coli MCE proteins show that YebT (LetB) forms an elongated tube consisting of seven stacked MCE rings, and PqiB adopts a syringe-like architecture. Both YebT and PqiB create channels of sufficient length to span the periplasmic space. These homologs transport lipids between the two membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, some eukaryotic organelles and possibly actinobacteria (Ekiert et al. 2017). MCE systems mediate phospholipid trafficking across the periplasm. ~3.5 \u00c5 cryo-EM structures of the E. coli MCE protein LetB reveals an ~0.6 megadalton complex that consists of seven stacked rings, with a central hydrophobic tunnel sufficiently long to span the periplasm (Isom et al. 2020). Lipids bind inside the tunnel, suggesting that it functions as the pathway for lipid transport. Cryo-EM structures in the open and closed states revealed a dynamic tunnel lining with implications for gating and substrate translocation. These results support a model in which LetB establishes a physical link between the two membranes and creates a  hydrophobic pathway for the translocation of lipids across the periplasm (Isom et al. 2020). The transmembrane subunit, MlaE, has minimal sequence similarity to other transporters.\u00a0Coudray et al. 2020 reported the cryo-EM structure of MlaFEDB at 3.05 \u00c5 resolution, revealing distant relationships to the LPS and MacAB transporters, as well as members of the eukaryotic ABCA\/ABCG families. A continuous transport pathway extends from the MlaE substrate- binding site, through the channel of MlaD, and into the periplasm. Two phospholipids are bound to MlaFEDB, suggesting that multiple lipid substrates may be transported each cycle. The structure provides mechanistic insight into substrate recognition and transport by MlaFEDB (Coudray et al. 2020). Structures of both the E. coli and P. aeruginosa MlaFEDB complexes have been determined by cryoEM (Zhou et al. 2021). The structures show that the MlaFEBD complex contains a total of twelve protein molecules with a stoichiometry of MlaF2E2B2D6, and binds a plethora of phospholipids (PLs) at different locations. In contrast to canonical ABC transporters, nucleotide binding fails to trigger significant conformational changes of both MlaFEBD and MlaFEB in the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane domains, correlated with their low ATPase activities exhibited in both detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs. PLs or detergents appeared to relocate to the membrane-proximal end from the distal end of the hydrophobic tunnel formed by the MlaD hexamer in MlaFEBD upon addition of ATP, indicating that retrograde PL transport might occur in the tunnel in an ATP-dependent manner. Site-specific photocrosslinking experiment confirmed that the substrate-binding pocket in the dimeric MlaE and the MlaD hexamer are able to bind PLs in vitro, in line with the notion that the MlaFEBD complex functions as a PL transporter (Zhou et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 5UWA  PBDID: 6GKI"},{"0":"3.A.1.28.2","1":"The folate transporter, FolT\/EcfAA''T (The 3-d structure is known to 3.0\u00c5 resolution (Xu et al. 2013; 4HUQ).

Uses the ERAD-associated E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, Hrd1p, which promotes polypeptide movement through the ER membrane (Carvalho et al., 2010; Bolte et al., 2011). As determined by cryoEM, Hrd1 is an 8 TMS dimer that associates with Hrd3 on the luminal side of the ER membrane to seal the channel used for protein retrotranslocation (Schoebel et al., 2017). The protein-conducting channel, Hrd1, is a ubiquitin ligase that serves as the transmembrane channel (Wu and Rapoport, 2018). The Cdc48\/p97 ATPase pulls the unfolded substrate through the channel, out of the membrane. Cdc48 has a central pore, and the substrate protein passes from the cis side to the trans side (Wu and Rapoport, 2018). Otu1, ubiquitin thio ligase, partially de-ubiquitinates the substrate protein. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase accepts ubiquitin specifically from endoplasmic reticulum-associated UBC6 and UBC7 E2 ligases, and transfers it to substrates, promoting their degradation. It mediates the degradation of a broad range of substrates, including endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins, soluble nuclear proteins and soluble cytoplasmic proteins. The DOA10 ubiquitin ligase complex is part of the ERAD-C pathway responsible for the rapid degradation of membrane proteins with misfolded cytoplasmic domains (Ravid et al., 2006). The 3-D structure of the Hrd1 complex (including Hrd1, Hrd3, Der1, Usa1 and Yos9) has been solved (Wu et al. 2020). It mediates the retrotranslocation of the polypeptide into the cytosol, which it is polyubiqutinated, extracted from the membrane by the Cdc48 ATPase complex and degraded by a proteosome. The importance of Hrd1 complex integrity during ERAD, suggests that allosteric interactions between transmembrane domains regulate Hrd1 complex formation (Nakatsukasa et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 6OA9  PBDID: 6OAA  PBDID: 6OAB  PBDID: 6OMB  PBDID: 6OPC  PBDID: 6JWH  PBDID: 6JWI  PBDID: 6JWJ  PBDID: 6OA9  PBDID: 6OAA  PBDID: 6VJZ  PBDID: 6VK0  PBDID: 5V6P  PBDID: 6VJY  PBDID: 6VJZ  PBDID: 6VK0  PBDID: 6VK1  PBDID: 5V7V  PBDID: 6VJY  PBDID: 6VJZ  PBDID: 6VK0  PBDID: 6VK1  PBDID: 6VK3  PBDID: 2YMA  PBDID: 6VK3  PBDID: 3BY4  PBDID: 3C0R  PBDID: 4KDI  PBDID: 4KDL  PBDID: 2M6M"},{"0":"3.A.16.1.4","1":"ERAD-L retrotranslocon system.

The nucleotide exchange factor, Grp170, a homolog of HSP70 proteins, plays a role in this ERAD pathway (Inoue and Tsai 2016).","2":"PBDID: 6A3Z  PBDID: 2DB7"},{"0":"3.A.16.1.5","1":"The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway of 47 proteins (Liu and Li 2014).","2":"PBDID: 6HD3  PBDID: 1WF9  PBDID: 6HD0"},{"0":"3.A.18.1.1","1":"The nuclear mRNA Export Complex (mRNA-E also called TREX) (including the exon junction complex) [TAP+p15 interact as a complex with the nuclear pore to facilitate mRNA transport to the cytoplasm] (Nojimma et al. 2007; Cheng et al., 2006)","2":"PBDID: 2HDE  PBDID: 2HYI  PBDID: 2J0Q  PBDID: 2J0S  PBDID: 2J0U  PBDID: 3EX7  PBDID: 2XB2  PBDID: 5XJC  PBDID: 5YZG  PBDID: 6ICZ  PBDID: 2HXY  PBDID: 2HYI  PBDID: 2J0Q  PBDID: 2J0S  PBDID: 2J0U  PBDID: 3EX7  PBDID: 2XB2  PBDID: 4C9B  PBDID: 5MQF  PBDID: 5XJC  PBDID: 5YZG  PBDID: 6ICZ  PBDID: 6QDV  PBDID: 6YVH  PBDID: 1P27  PBDID: 2HYI  PBDID: 2J0Q  PBDID: 2J0S  PBDID: 3EX7  PBDID: 2XB2  PBDID: 1T5I  PBDID: 1T6N  PBDID: 1XTI  PBDID: 1XTJ  PBDID: 1XTK  PBDID: 4A8X  PBDID: 1MP1  PBDID: 6FF4  PBDID: 6FF7  PBDID: 2WX3  PBDID: 4B6H  PBDID: 1FO1  PBDID: 1FT8  PBDID: 1GO5  PBDID: 1JKG  PBDID: 1JN5  PBDID: 1KOH  PBDID: 1KOO  PBDID: 1OAI  PBDID: 2Z5K  PBDID: 2Z5M  PBDID: 3RW6  PBDID: 3RW7  PBDID: 4WYK  PBDID: 6E5U  PBDID: 6G6S  PBDID: 1P27  PBDID: 2HYI  PBDID: 2J0Q  PBDID: 2J0S  PBDID: 3EX7  PBDID: 2XB2  PBDID: 5XJC  PBDID: 5YZG  PBDID: 6ICZ  PBDID: 6QDV  PBDID: 6B4F  PBDID: 6B4I  PBDID: 6B4J"},{"0":"3.A.19.1.1","1":"The ATP hydrolysis-dependent TRC receptor TRC40 (Asna-1) which functions as a chaparone protein, feeding into the WRB\/CAML transporter complex (McDowell et al. 2020; Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007). TRC40 is homologous to the ArsA ATPase of E. coli (TC# 3.A.4.1.1) and the GET3 ATPase of yeast (TC# 8.A.26.1.1). Loss yields embryonic lethality. Tryptophan-rich basic protein (WRB) is the tail-anchored (TA) protein insertion receptor, also called congenital heart disease protein-5 (CHD5). It is related to the yeast Get1 protein in 3.A.21.1.1.\u00a0Calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) is a mammal-specific receptor for TRC40, an ATPase targeting newly synthesized TA proteins. CAML mediates membrane insertion of TA proteins. TRC40 (Asna1) has been shown to mediate membrane insertion of two proteins, RAMP4 and Sec61beta, without the participation of other cytosolic proteins by a mechanism that depends on the presence of ATP or ADP and a protease-sensitive receptor in the ER membrane (Favaloro et al. 2010). TRC40 is required for release of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) virions (Ott et al. 2016). The functions and reciprocal interactions of the two subunits of the heteromeric TRC40 recpeptor, WBR and CAML (CAMLG), have revealed mutual dependencies for stability; CAML seems to normally be present in 5-fold excess over WBR (Colombo et al. 2016). CAMLG interacts with Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) p7 and mediates calcium permeability in the ER (Gladue et al. 2018). Retro-2 (Morgens et al. 2019) protects cells from ricin and Shiga-like toxin toxicity by inhibiting ASNA1-mediated ER targeting and insertion of tail-anchored proteins (Morgens et al. 2019). Get3 (TRC40) binding to the membrane insertase supports heterotetramer formation, and phosphatidylinositol binding at the heterotetramer interface stabilizes the insertase for efficient TA insertion in vivo.\u00a0McDowell et al. 2020 identified a Get2\/CAML cytoplasmic helix that forms a \"gating\" interaction with Get3\/TRC40, important for TA insertion. Structural homology with YidC and the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) suggests an evolutionarily conserved insertion mechanism for divergent substrates utilizing a hydrophilic groove (McDowell et al. 2020). The WRB subunit of the Get3 receptor is required for the correct integration of its partner CAML into the ER (Carvalho et al. 2019). Close coordination between chaperones is essential for the delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins containing a single C-terminal TMS to the ER by the GET pathway. For successful targeting, nascent TA proteins must be promptly chaperoned and loaded onto the cytosolic ATPase Get3 through a transfer reaction involving the chaperone SGTA and bridging factors, Get4, Ubl4a and Bag6.\u00a0Keszei et al. 2021 reported cryo-EM structures of metazoan pretargeting GET complexes at 3.3-3.6 \u00c5 resolution. Get3 helix 8 and the Get4 C terminus form a composite lid over the Get3 substrate-binding chamber that is opened by SGTA. Another interaction with Get4 prevents formation of Get3 helix 4, which links the substrate chamber and ATPase domain. Both interactions facilitate TA protein transfer from SGTA to Get3 (Keszei et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 6SO5  PBDID: 6SO5  PBDID: 6SO5"},{"0":"3.A.19.1.3","1":"Get3 ATPase homologue of 349 aas and 0 TMSs that drives the insertion of tail anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

ATPase is required for the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the chloroplast. It is also required for  the accumulation of TOC34, an essential component of the outer chloroplast membrane translocon (TOC) complex (Formighieri et al. 2013, Maestre-Reyna et al. 2017). ArsA1 recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets the protein to the chloroplast, where  the tail-anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis (Maestre-Reyna et al. 2017). Both ArsA proteins exhibit oxyanion-independent ATPase activity, but co-expression of ArsA proteins with TA-transmembrane regions showed not only that the former interacts with the latter, but that ArsA1 does not share the same ligand specificity as ArsA2. ArsA1 mainly carries TA-proteins to the chloroplast, while ArsA2 carries them to the endoplasmic reticulum (Maestre-Reyna et al. 2017). Lin et al. 2019 presented crystal structures of algal ArsA1 (a Get3 homolog) in a distinct nucleotide-free open state and bound to adenylyl-imidodiphosphate. This approximately 80-kDa protein possesses a  monomeric architecture, with two ATPase domains in a single polypeptide  chain. It is capable of binding chloroplast (TOC34 and TOC159) and mitochondrial (TOM7) TA proteins based on features of its transmembrane domain as well as the regions immediately before and after the transmembrane domain. Several helices located above the TA-binding groove comprise the interlocking hook-like motif implicated by mutational analyses in TA substrate recognition. The data of Lin et al. 2019 provide insights into the molecular basis of the highly specific selectivity of interactions of algal ArsA1 with the correct sets of TA substrates before membrane targeting in plant cells.","2":"PBDID: 5ZME  PBDID: 5ZMF"},{"0":"3.A.2.1.1","1":"H+-translocating F-type ATPase. The loop-regions in subunits a and c that are implicated in H+ transport likely interact in a single structural domain which then functions in gating H+ release to the cytoplasm (Steed et al. 2014). Three different states that relate to rotation of the enzyme have been observed, with the central stalk's epsilon subunit in an extended autoinhibitory conformation in all three states (Sobti et al. 2016). The Fo motor consists of seven transmembrane helices and a decameric c-ring, and invaginations on either side of the membrane indicate the entry and exit channels for protons. The proton translocating subunit contains near parallel helices inclined by ~30 degrees to the membrane, a feature corresponding to rotary ATPases. This rotary ATPase subtype, the peripheral stalk, is resolved over the entire length of the complex, revealing the F1 attachment points and a coiled-coil that bifurcates toward the membrane with its helices separating to embrace subunit a from two sides (Sobti et al. 2016). Reversible beta\/epsilon (stator\/rotor) interactions may block rotation and thereby inhibit catalysis (Bulygin et al. 2004).","2":"PBDID: 1AQT  PBDID: 1BSH  PBDID: 1BSN  PBDID: 1FS0  PBDID: 1QO1  PBDID: 3OAA  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR  PBDID: 1C17  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6VWK  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR  PBDID: 1B9U  PBDID: 1L2P  PBDID: 2KHK  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6VWK  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR  PBDID: 1ABV  PBDID: 2A7U  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR  PBDID: 1D8S  PBDID: 1FS0  PBDID: 3OAA  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR  PBDID: 1D8S  PBDID: 3OAA  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR  PBDID: 1D8S  PBDID: 3OAA  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR  PBDID: 1A91  PBDID: 1ATY  PBDID: 1C0V  PBDID: 1C17  PBDID: 1C99  PBDID: 1IJP  PBDID: 1J7F  PBDID: 1L6T  PBDID: 1QO1  PBDID: 4UTQ  PBDID: 5T4O  PBDID: 5T4P  PBDID: 5T4Q  PBDID: 6OQR  PBDID: 6OQS  PBDID: 6OQT  PBDID: 6OQU  PBDID: 6OQV  PBDID: 6OQW  PBDID: 6PQV  PBDID: 6VWK  PBDID: 6WNQ  PBDID: 6WNR"},{"0":"3.A.2.1.11","1":"F-type ATP synthase of 8 subunits common to other ATPases, and 9 subunits unique to the Chlorophyta.

The spinich enzyme has been solved at 3.4 \u00c5 resolution by cryoEM (Hahn et al. 2018). The protein has 26 protein subunits, 17 of them membrane embedded. Its c-ring has 14 c subunits. Hahn et al. 2018 observed 3 chloroplast F1F0 conformations with the central rotor stalled in different positions, and ring rotation seemed to be divided into 3 unequal stteps. The stoichiometrically mismatched c-ring of F0s (composed of 8 to 17 c-subunits) and the 3-fold symmetric F1 head are flexibly coupled (Murphy et al. 2019). Based on cryo EM 2.7 \u00c5 resolution structures, 13 rotary states suggest a mechanism of the rotational movement, and the functions of novel subunits are proposed (Murphy et al. 2019). The chloroplast ATP synthase (CF1Fo) contains a feature specific to the green lineage: a gamma-subunit redox domain that contains a cysteine couple which interacts with the torque-transmitting betaDELSEED-loop. This thiol modulation equips CF1Fo with an important environmental fine-tuning mechanism. In vitro, disulfide formation in the gamma-redox domain slows down the activity of CF1Fo at low transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. ATP synthase regulation by the proton motive force (pmf) and thiol modulation occur in Arabidopsis leaves (Buchert et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 6RD4  PBDID: 6RD6  PBDID: 6RD9  PBDID: 6RDA  PBDID: 6RDB

Evidence of the proximity of ATP synthase subunit 6 is in proximity to the membrane in the supramolecular form (Velours et al., 2011). The structure of the intact monomeric ATP synthase from the fungus, Pichia angusta, has been solved by electron cryo-microscopy (Vinothkumar et al. 2016). The Mg2+ and Ca2+-dependent enzymes are both active, but exhibit quite different behaviors (Nesci et al. 2017). Dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds (cristae) characteristic of mitochondria. Using cryo-electron microscopy,\u00a0Guo et al. 2017 determined the structure of the dimeric FO complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the protons travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae. The crystal structure of the c-subunit ring with bound oligomycin revealed the inhibitor docked on the outer face of the proton-binding sites, deep in the transmembrane region (Zhou and Faraldo-G\u00f3mez 2018). A high resolution (3.7\u00a0\u00c5) structure of the entire monomeric ATPase has been solved by cryo EM, suggesting how it is inhibited by oligomycin (Srivastava et al. 2018). Absence of the e and g subunits decreases conductance of the F-ATP synthase channel about tenfold. Ablation of the first TMS of subunit b, which creates a distinct lateral domain with e and g, further affected channel activity. Thus, F-ATP synthase e, g and b subunits create a domain within the membrane that is critical for the generation of the high-conductance channel that is a prime candidate for formation of the permeability transition pore (PTP). Subunits e and g are only present in eukaryotes and may have evolved to confer this novel function to F-ATP synthases (Carraro et al. 2018). The translation rate of all yeast mitochondrial mRNAs, including all F-type ATPase subunits has been studied (Chicherin et al. 2021). Attenuated ADP-inhibition of F0F1 ATPase mitigates manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast (Lapashina et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2HLD  PBDID: 3FKS  PBDID: 2WPD  PBDID: 2XOK  PBDID: 3OE7  PBDID: 3OEE  PBDID: 3OEH  PBDID: 3OFN  PBDID: 3ZIA  PBDID: 3ZRY  PBDID: 4B2Q  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6B2Z  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP5  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6CP7  PBDID: 6WTD  PBDID: 6B2Z  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP5  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6CP7  PBDID: 6WTD  PBDID: 6B2Z  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP5  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6CP7  PBDID: 6WTD  PBDID: 2HLD  PBDID: 3FKS  PBDID: 2WPD  PBDID: 2XOK  PBDID: 3OE7  PBDID: 3OEE  PBDID: 3OEH  PBDID: 3OFN  PBDID: 3ZIA  PBDID: 3ZRY  PBDID: 4B2Q  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 2HLD  PBDID: 3FKS  PBDID: 2WPD  PBDID: 3OE7  PBDID: 3OEE  PBDID: 3OEH  PBDID: 3OFN  PBDID: 3ZIA  PBDID: 4B2Q  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6B2Z  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP5  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6CP7  PBDID: 6WTD  PBDID: 2HLD  PBDID: 3FKS  PBDID: 2WPD  PBDID: 2XOK  PBDID: 3OE7  PBDID: 3OEE  PBDID: 3OEH  PBDID: 3OFN  PBDID: 3ZIA  PBDID: 3ZRY  PBDID: 4B2Q  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 2WPD  PBDID: 2XOK  PBDID: 3U2F  PBDID: 3U2Y  PBDID: 3U32  PBDID: 3UD0  PBDID: 3ZRY  PBDID: 4B2Q  PBDID: 4F4S  PBDID: 5BPS  PBDID: 5BQ6  PBDID: 5BQA  PBDID: 5BQJ  PBDID: 6B2Z  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP5  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6CP7  PBDID: 6WTD  PBDID: 2HLD  PBDID: 3FKS  PBDID: 2WPD  PBDID: 2XOK  PBDID: 3OE7  PBDID: 3OEE  PBDID: 3OEH  PBDID: 3OFN  PBDID: 3ZIA  PBDID: 3ZRY  PBDID: 4B2Q  PBDID: 6B8H  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP6  PBDID: 6CP3  PBDID: 6CP6"},{"0":"3.A.2.1.7","1":"F-type ATPase.

The V-ATPase of E. hirae (EhV-ATPase) is composed of a soluble catalytic domain (V1; NtpA3-B3-D-G) and an integral membrane domain (V0; NtpI-K10) connected by a central and two peripheral stalks (NtpC, NtpD-G and NtpE-F) (see schematic figure 1 on pg. 60 of Muhammed et al., 2012). The membrane rotor ring of the Na+-ATPase consists of 10 NtpK subunits, which are homologs of the 16-KDa and 8-KDa proteolipids found in other V-ATPases and F-ATPases. Each NtpK subunit has four transmembrane alpha helices, with a sodium ion bound between helices 2 and 4 at a site buried deeply in the membrane that includes the essential residue glutamate-139 (Murata et al. 2005). This site is probably connected to the membrane surface by two half-channels in subunit NtpI, against which the ring rotates. Symmetry mismatch between the rotor and catalytic domains appears to be an intrinsic feature of both V- and F-ATPases (Murata et al. 2005). The EhV-ATPase is a Na+ pump in.\u00a0Tsunoda et al. 2018 presented the entire structure of detergent-solubilized EhV-ATPase by single-particle cryo-EM using Zernike phase plates. The cryo-EM map showed one of three catalytic conformations. To further stabilize the originally heterogeneous structure caused by ATP hydrolysis, a peptide epitope tag system interfered with rotation of the central rotor by binding the Fab. As a result, the map unexpectedly showed another catalytic conformation of EhV-ATPase. These two conformations with and without Fab conversely coincided with those of the minor state 2 and the major state 1 of Thermus thermophilus V\/A-ATPase, respectively. The most prominent feature in EhV-ATPase was the off-axis rotor, where the cytoplasmic V1 domain was connected to the Vo domain through the off-axis central rotor. Compared to the structure of ATP synthases, the larger size of the interface between the transmembrane a-subunit and c-ring of EhV-ATPase would be more advantageous for active ion pumping (Tsunoda et al. 2018).","2":"PBDID: 3AON  PBDID: 3VR4  PBDID: 3VR5  PBDID: 3VR6  PBDID: 5KNB  PBDID: 5KNC  PBDID: 5KND  PBDID: 2BL2  PBDID: 2CYD  PBDID: 2DB4  PBDID: 3AOU  PBDID: 3VR2  PBDID: 3VR3  PBDID: 3VR4  PBDID: 3VR5  PBDID: 3VR6  PBDID: 5KNB  PBDID: 5KNC  PBDID: 5KND  PBDID: 5ZE9  PBDID: 5ZEA  PBDID: 3VR2  PBDID: 3VR3  PBDID: 3VR4  PBDID: 3VR5  PBDID: 3VR6  PBDID: 5KNB  PBDID: 5KNC  PBDID: 5KND  PBDID: 5ZE9  PBDID: 5ZEA  PBDID: 3AON  PBDID: 3VR4  PBDID: 3VR5  PBDID: 3VR6  PBDID: 5KNB  PBDID: 5KNC  PBDID: 5KND"},{"0":"3.A.2.2.3","1":"H+-translocating V-type ATPase. The d-subunit couples ATP hydrolysis to H+ transport (Owegi et al., 2006). The a subunit (Vph1p) most likely has an 8 TMS topology (Kartner et al. 2013; Knight and Behm 2012). Structures for three rotational states show ten proteolipid subunits in the c-ring, setting the ATP:H+ ratio for proton pumping. Long tilted TMSs in the a-subunit interact with the c-ring. V-ATPase's membrane sector, Vo, has been implicated in functions including membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release. Couoh-Cardel et al. 2016 reported that the purified V-ATPase c subunit ring (c-ring) forms dimers mediated by the c subunits' cytoplasmic loops. Electrophysiological measurements of the c-ring reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer revealed a large unitary conductance of ~8.3 nS. A role of the c-ring in membrane fusion and neuronal communication was suggested (Couoh-Cardel et al. 2016).  The three different maps reveal the conformational changes that occur to couple rotation in the symmetry-mismatched soluble catalytic region to the membrane-bound proton-translocating region. Almost all of the subunits undergo conformational changes during the transitions between these three rotational states (Zhao et al. 2015). The structures of these states provide direct evidence that deformation during rotation enables the smooth transmission of power through rotary ATPases. Increases in glucose stimulate V-ATPase assembly and activity while glucose deprivation triggers rapid V-ATPase disassembly and inactivation in yeast. However, the opposite phenomenon is observed in mammalian cells, specifically that V-ATPase assembly and activation increases when  glucose is lost (Parra and Hayek 2018).  The 3.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution cryoEM structure of the lipid nanodisc-reconstituted Vo proton channel, captured in a physiologically relevant  autoinhibited state, revealing the residues that constitute the proton pathway at the interface of the proteolipid ring and subunit a has been solved (Roh et al. 2018). The chemical basis of transmembrane proton transport was proposed. Roh et al. 2018 discovered that the C terminus of the assembly factor Voa1 (TC# 9.B.206.2.1)) is an integral component of the mature Vo. Voa1's C-terminal transmembrane alpha helix is bound inside the proteolipid ring, where it contributes to the stability of the complex. The structure rationalizes possible mechanisms  by which mutations in human Vo can result in disease phenotypes.  An arginine residue (Arg-735) in transmembrane helix 7 (TMS7) of subunit a of the yeast ATPase is known to be essential  for proton translocation. Arginine residues are usually assumed to 'snorkel' toward the protein surface when exposed to a hydrophobic environment. However, Hohlweg et al. 2018 obtained evidence for  the formation of a transient, membrane-embedded cation-\u03c0 interaction in  TM7 between Arg-735 and two highly conserved nearby aromatic residues, Tyr-733 and Trp-737. They proposed a mechanism by which the transient, membrane-embedded cation-\u03c0 complex provides the necessary energy to keep  the charged side chain of Arg-735 within the hydrophobic membrane. Such  cation-\u03c0 interactions may define a general mechanism to retain charged amino acids in a hydrophobic membrane environment (Hohlweg et al. 2018). A 2.7-A cryo-EM structure of the yeast Vo proton channel revealed the location of ordered water molecules along the proton path, details of specific protein-lipid interactions, and the architecture of the membrane scaffold protein (Roh et al. 2020) as well as a state of Vo showing the c-ring rotated by ~14 degrees. Two rotary states are in thermal equilibrium and depict how the protonation state of essential glutamic acid residues couples water-mediated proton transfer with c-ring rotation.

Peroxisomal biogenesis factor PEX26 is a membrane anchor for the multi-subunit PEX1-PEX6 protein complex that controls ubiquitination and dislocation of PEX5 cargo receptors for peroxisomal matrix protein import. PEX26 associates with the peroxisomal translocation pore via PEX14 (Guder et al. 2018). Luminal peroxisomal proteins are imported from the cytosol by mobile receptors, which then recycle back to the cytosol by a poorly understood process (Feng et al. 2022). Recycling requires receptor modification by a membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase complex comprising three RING finger domain-containing proteins (Pex2, Pex10 and Pex12). Feng et al. 2022 reported a cryo-EM structure of the ligase complex, which together with biochemical and in vivo experiments reveals its function as a retrotranslocation channel for peroxisomal import receptors. Each subunit of the complex contributes five transmembrane segments that co-assemble into an open channel. The three ring finger domains form a cytosolic tower, with ring finger 2 (RF2) positioned above the channel pore. The N terminus of a recycling receptor is inserted from the peroxisomal lumen into the pore and monoubiquitylated by RF2 to enable extraction into the cytosol. If recycling is compromised, receptors are polyubiquitylated by the concerted action of RF10 and RF12 and degraded. This polyubiquitylation pathway also maintains the homeostasis of other peroxisomal import factors. Thus, a crucial step during peroxisomal protein import is clarified, and it explains why mutations in the ligase complex cause human disease (Feng et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2W84  PBDID: 2W85  PBDID: 4BXU  PBDID: 2Y9M  PBDID: 2Y9P  PBDID: 4BWF  PBDID: 1A3S  PBDID: 1KPS  PBDID: 1Z5S  PBDID: 2GRN  PBDID: 2GRO  PBDID: 2GRP  PBDID: 2GRQ  PBDID: 2GRR  PBDID: 2O25  PBDID: 2PE6  PBDID: 2PX9  PBDID: 2XWU  PBDID: 3A4S  PBDID: 3UIN  PBDID: 3UIO  PBDID: 3UIP  PBDID: 4Y1L  PBDID: 4W5V  PBDID: 5D2M  PBDID: 5F6D  PBDID: 5F6E  PBDID: 5F6U  PBDID: 5F6V  PBDID: 5F6W  PBDID: 5F6X  PBDID: 5F6Y  PBDID: 5FQ2  PBDID: 6SYF  PBDID: 1UR6  PBDID: 1W4U  PBDID: 2CLW  PBDID: 2ESK  PBDID: 2ESO  PBDID: 2ESP  PBDID: 2ESQ  PBDID: 3A33  PBDID: 3JVZ  PBDID: 3JW0  PBDID: 3L1Y  PBDID: 3TGD  PBDID: 3ZNI  PBDID: 4A49  PBDID: 4A4B  PBDID: 4A4C  PBDID: 4AUQ  PBDID: 4DDG  PBDID: 4LDT  PBDID: 4V3K  PBDID: 4V3L  PBDID: 4WZ3  PBDID: 5D0K  PBDID: 5D0M  PBDID: 5D1K  PBDID: 5D1L  PBDID: 5D1M  PBDID: 4DDI  PBDID: 5EDV  PBDID: 5MNJ  PBDID: 5ULF  PBDID: 5ULH  PBDID: 5ULK  PBDID: 5VZW  PBDID: 5ZBU  PBDID: 6HPR  PBDID: 6SQO  PBDID: 6SQR  PBDID: 6SQS  PBDID: 6TTU  PBDID: 6W7Z  PBDID: 6W9D"},{"0":"3.A.20.1.2","1":"The peroxin complex for the import of proteins into the matrix of peroxisomes (Prestele et al., 2010).

This system (ESX-1) is present in the avirulent species, Mycobacterium smegmatis, where it is involved in conjugation (Coros et al. 2008). ESX-1 uses the ESX-1-specific chaparone protein, EspG to interact with the secreted PE\/PPE complex, while a homologous EspG specific for ESX-5 functions with the PE\/PPE complex secreted by ESX-5. Thus, EspG proteins may be system-specific chaparones for T7SSs (Daleke et al. 2012). The main secreted virulence protein complex is a heterodimer: EsxA(ESAT-6)\/EsxB(CFP-10) (Rosenberger et al. 2012). EccB, a periplasmic homoheximer with the ATP-binding active site shared by two adjacent subunits, may act as the energy provider in the transport of T7SS virulence factors and may be involved in the formation of a channel across the mycomembrane (Zhang et al. 2015). ESX-1 functions in resistance to and evasion of host responses. It induces phagosomal rupture which releases bacteria into the cytosol of the host phagocytes (Gr\u00f6schel et al. 2016). ESX-1 secrete EsxA and EsxB, which form a heterodimer, seem to have differing functions as EsxA can disrupt lipid bilayers (RBC and artificial membranes.

The EccB5, EccC5, EccD5 and EccE5 proteins form a membrane complex of about 1.5 MDa while EccA5 may be the channel-forming subunit that exports the substrate proteins (Bunduc et al. 2021). Thus, ESX-5 exports protein substrate (Houben et al. 2012). PE25\/PPE41form a heterodimer that is targeted to the T7SS, ESX5, by a C-terminal signal in PE25 which is necessary but not sufficient for targeting to ESX5 (Daleke et al. 2012). An esx-5 mutant is strongly impaired in the uptake and utilization of hydrophobic carbon sources. Possibly the ESX-5 system is responsible for the transport of cell envelope  proteins that are required for nutrient uptake (Ates et al. 2015). Mycobacterium tuberculosis releases membrane vesicles (MV) that modulate host immune responses and aid in iron acquisition, and the ESX-5 system seems to play a role, together with the SenX3-RegX3 complex which regulates the process (White et al. 2018). The 3-D structure of ESX-5 has been determined (Bunduc et al. 2021) (see ESX5 family description, paragraph 11 for details). The structure of the mycobacterial ESX-5 type VII secretion system pore complex has been determined (Beckham et al. 2021). The high-resolution structure of the 2.1-megadalton ESX-5 core complex captured a dynamic, secretion-competent conformation of the pore within a well-defined transmembrane section, sandwiched between two flexible protein layers at the cytosolic entrance and the periplasmic exit. Beckham et al. 2021 proposed that this flexibility endows the ESX-5 machinery with large conformational plasticity required to accommodate targeted protein secretion. A highly dynamic state of the pore may represent a fundamental principle of bacterial secretion machineries.","2":"PBDID: 4KXR  PBDID: 5XFS"},{"0":"3.A.25.2.1","1":"The SELMA system in the apicoplast of the malaria paraiste, Plasmodium falciparum\u00a0(Spork et al. 2009).","2":"PBDID: 2H2Y"},{"0":"3.A.26.1.1","1":"The Plasmodium Translocon of Exported proteins (PTEX) complex included Exp2 (283 aas; one N-terminal TMS plus 8 putative TM \u03b2-strands), Clp protease and ATPase (ClpB2). and translocon components, PTEX150 (993 aas with one N-terminal TMS and as many as 22 TM putative \u03b2-strands), pTEX88 (777 aas with one or two N-terminal\u00a0\u03b1-helical TMSs and as many as 30 TM \u03b2-strandsm and thioredoxin-2 (Trx2; 157 aas, one N-terminal TMS).

It has been suggested that the Exp-2 protein serves as the channel for export (Mes\u00e9n-Ram\u00edrez et al. 2016), and this has been demonstrated (Hakamada et al. 2016). EXP2 formed pores in bilayer lipid membranes with an inner diameter of approximately 3.5\u00a0nm. The pore consists of 10-12 EXP2 subunits (Hakamada et al. 2017), and the N-terminus of EXP2 plays a role in pore formation (Sanders et al. 2018). An additional component of the complex may be Pf113 (Miyazaki et al. 2021). EXP2, the transmembrane protein of a translocon from malaria parasites has pore-forming properties in the lipid bilayer and forms a nanopore with a diameter of 2.5 nm assembled from 7 monomers. Using the EXP2 nanopore allowed detection of poly-L-lysine (PLL) at a single-molecule level. The EXP2 nanopore has sufficient resolution to distinguish the difference in molecular weight between two individual PLL, long PLL (MW: 30,000-70,000) and short PLL (MW: 10,000) and thus functions as a peptide-detectable nanopore (Miyagi et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 6E10  PBDID: 6E11  PBDID: 3UL3  PBDID: 4O32  PBDID: 2F6I"},{"0":"3.A.27.1.1","1":"ER membrane protein insertase complex of ten recognized proteins, EMC1 - 10 (Guna et al. 2018).

On the basis of this unique architecture,\u00a0Kater et al. 2020 proposed an airlock-like translocation mechanism for folded Rip1.","2":"PBDID: 6SH3  PBDID: 6SH4  PBDID: 6SH5"},{"0":"3.A.29.1.1","1":"The mitochondrial i-AAA protease complex involved in inner membrane insertion and turnover.

Kinetic alterations due to a missense mutation in the alpha2 subunit cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (Segall et al. 2004). Mutation in the \u03b3-subunit causes renal hypomagnesemia, associated with hypocalciurea (Cairo et al., 2008). The Na\/K-ATPase is an important signal transducer that not only interacts and regulates protein kinases, but also functions as a scaffold (Li and Xie, 2009). Capsazepine, a synthetic vanilloid, converts the Na, K-ATPase to a Na-ATPase (Mahmmoud, 2008a). There are alternative \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits, \u03b11, \u03b12,... \u03b21, \u03b22,... in muscle which form \u03b11\u03b21, \u03b11\u03b22, \u03b12\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b22, heterodimers, each with differing Na+ affinities (4-13mM) (Kristensen and Juel, 2010). \u03b13 and \u03b23 isoforms have also been identified. The \u03b3-subunit is the same as TC# 1.A.27.2.1. Poulsen et al. (2010) have proposed a second ion conduction pathway in the C-terminal part of the ATPase. The two C-terminal tyrosines stabilize the occluded Na\/K pump conformations containing Na or K ions (Vedovato and Gadsby, 2010). Na+, K+-ATPase mutations causing familial hemiplegic migraines type 2 (FHM2) inhibit phosphorylation (Schack et al., 2012). Salt, the vascular Na+\/K+\u00a0ATPase and the endogenous glycosides, ouabain and marinobufagenin, play roles in systemic hypertension (Hauck and Frishman, 2012).\u00a0Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of Ser936 (in the intracellular loop between transmembrane segments M8 and M9) opens an intracellular C-terminal water pathway leading to the third Na+-binding site (Poulsen et al., 2012). PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates activity in vivo. Ser-938 is located (Einholm et al. 2016). E960 on the Na+-K+-ATPase and F28 on phospholemman (PLM) are critical for phospholemman (PLM) inhibition, but there is at least one additional site that is important for tethering PLM to the ATPase. Mutations in the Na+\/K+-ATPase \u03b13 subunit gene (ATP1A3) cause rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, a rare movement disorder characterized by sudden onset of dystonic spasms and slow movements (Do\u00c4\u009fanli et al. 2013). The 3-d strcuture of the Na+-bound Na+,K+-ATPase at 4.3\u00a0\u00c5 resolution reveals the positions of the three Na+ ions (Nyblom et al. 2013). Mutations cause adrenal hypertension (Kopec et al. 2014) as well as alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) and rapid-onset dystonia- parkinsonism (RDP) (Rosewich et al. 2014). Differences in the structures of the ouabain-, digonxin- and bufalin-bound enzyme have been reported (Laursen et al. 2015). ATPase inhibitors have been shown to be effective anti-cancer agents (Alevizopoulos et al. 2014). Cys45 in the \u03b2-subunit can be glutathionylated, regulating the activity of the enzyme (Garcia et al. 2015). ATP1A2 mutations play a role in migraine headaches (Friedrich et al. 2016). The beta2 subunit is essential for motor physiology in mammals, and in contrast to beta1 and beta3, beta2 stabilizes the Na+-occluded E1P state relative to the outward-open E2P state (Hilbers et al. 2016). Numerous transcription factors, hormones, growth factors, lipids, and extracellular stimuli as well as epigenetic signals modulate the transcription of Na,K-ATPase subunits (Li and Langhans 2015). \u00c4\u008cechov\u00e1 et al. 2016 have identified two cytoplasmic pathways along the pairs of TMSs, TMS3\/TMS7 or TM6S\/TMS9 that allow hydration of the cation binding sites or transport of cations from\/to the bulk medium. Dissipation of the transmembrane gradient of K+ and Na+ due to ouabain inhibition increases Ptgs2 and Nr4a1 transcription by increasing Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels that, in turn, leads to CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of CREB and calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT, respectively (Smolyaninova et al. 2017). ZMay play a role in the development of gastric adenocarcinomas (Wang et al. 2017). Mutations F785L and T618M give rise to familial rapid onset dystonia parkonsonism by distinct mechanisms (Rodacker et al. 2006). Reacts with methylglyoxal to inhibit its activity (Svrckova et al. 2017). Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by reduction of Na,K-ATPase functional activity.\u00a0Petrushanko et al. 2016 showed that monomeric Abeta(1-42) forms a tight (Kd of 3 m\u03bcM), enthalpy-driven equimolar complex with alpha1beta1 Na,K-ATPase. Complex formation results in dose-dependent inhibition of the enzyme hydrolytic activity. The binding site of Abeta(1-42) is localized in the \"gap\" between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits of Na,K-ATPase, disrupting the enzyme functionality by preventing the subunits from shifting towards each other. Interaction of Na,K-ATPase with exogenous Abeta(1-42) leads to a pronounced decrease of the enzyme transport and hydrolytic activities and Src-kinase activation in neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y. This interaction allows regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by short-term increases in the Abeta(1-42) level (Petrushanko et al. 2016). Two distinct phospholipids bind to two distinct sites on the ATPase, affecting activity and stability (Habeck et al. 2017). Five cysteinyl residues (C452, C456, C457, C577, and C656) serve as the cisplatin binding sites on the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices 4 and 5 (\u0160eflov\u00e1 et al. 2018). Mutations can cause F\/SHM with moderate penitrance (Prontera et al. 2018). Arginine substitution of a cysteine in transmembrane helix M8 converts the Na+,K+-ATPase to an electroneutral pump similar to the gastric H+,K+-ATPase (Holm et al. 2017). Early onset life-threatening epilepsy can be associated with ATP1A3 gene variants (Ishihara et al. 2019), and loss of Na\/K pump function is the common feature of mutants that induce hyperaldosteronism (Meyer et al. 2019). Three Na+ sites are defined in the Na+-bound crystal structure of the Na+, K+-ATPase. Sites I and II overlap with two K+ sites in the K+-bound structure, whereas site III is unique and Na+ specific. A glutamine in transmembrane helix M8 (Q925) appears from the crystal structures to coordinate Na+ at site III, but does not contribute to K+ coordination at sites I and II.\u00a0Nielsen et al. 2019 addressed the functional role of Q925 in the various conformational states of this-ATPase by examining the mutants Q925A\/G\/E\/N\/L\/I\/Y both enzymatically and electrophysiologically, thereby revealing their Na+ and K+ binding properties. Q925 substitutions had minor effects on Na+ binding from the intracellular side of the membrane, but mutations Q925A and Q925G increased the apparent Na+ affinity, but caused dramatic reductions of the binding of K+ as well as Na+ from the extracellular side of the membrane. Thus, an interaction between sites III and I and a possible gating function of Q925 in the release of Na+ at the extracellular side are supported (Nielsen et al. 2019). The alpha2 Na+\/K+-ATPase isoform mediates LPS-induced neuroinflammation (Leite et al. 2020). Apical periodontitis induces changes on oxidative stress parameters and increases Na+\/K+-ATPase activity in adult rats (Barcelos et al. 2020). Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 can be due to a missense mutation (L425H) in ATP1A2 (Antonaci et al. 2021). Mutations in ATP1A3 and FXYD genes (TC# 1.A.27) can cause childhood-onset schizophrenia (Chaumette et al. 2020). The ATPase plays a role in cell adhesion, motility, and migration of cancer cells (Silva et al. 2021). TMS2 moves outward as Na+ is deoccluded from the E1 conformation (Young and Artigas 2021). Kinetic properties and crystal structures of the Na+,K+-ATPase in complex with cardiotonic steroids (CTS) has revealed differences between CTS subfamilies.\u00a0Ladefoged et al. 2021 found beneficial effects of K+ on bufadienolide binding in contrast to the well-known antagonism between K+ and cardenolides. Bufadienolide binding is affected by (i) electrostatic attraction of the lactone ring by a cation and (ii) the ability of a cation to stabilize and \"shape\" the site constituted by transmembrane helices of the alpha-subunit (\u03b1M1-6). The latter effect was due to varying coordination patterns involving amino acid residues from helix bundles \u03b1M1-4 and \u03b1M5-10. Substituents on the steroid core of a bufadienolide add to and modify the cation effects (Ladefoged et al. 2021). The Na+-K+-ATPase functions in the developing hippocampus (Shao et al. 2021). CryoEM analyses of the Na+,K+-ATPase in the two E2P states with and without cardiotonic steroids has revealed mechanistic details (Kanai et al. 2022). A conserved ion-binding site tyrosine plays a role in ion selectivity of the Na+\/K+ pump (Spontarelli et al. 2022). Essential roles of the Na+K+-ATPase in ischemic pathology provide a platform for the improvement in clinical research on ischemic stroke (Zhu et al. 2022). In intact live cells, the regulatory complex is composed of two alpha subunits associated with two beta subunits, decorated with two PLM regulatory subunits. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generated a structural model of the complex. alpha-alpha subunit interactions support conformational coupling of the catalytic subunits, which may enhance the NKA turnover rate (Seflova et al. 2022). There is a phenotypic continuum of ATP1A3-related disorders (Vezyroglou et al. 2022). The Na+\/K+-ATPase is central to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases such as alternating hemiplegia of childhood. This ATPase has 3 distinct ion binding sites I-III. Binding of Na+ at each site in the human alpha3 Na+\/K+-ATPase can be resolved using extracellular Na+-mediated transient currents. When the ATPase is constrained to bind and release only Na+, three kinetic components: fast, medium, and slow, can be isolated, depending on the voltage step direction and the occlusion (or deocclusion) of each of the 3 Na+s. Patient-derived mutations of residues which coordinate Na+ at site III exclusively impact the slow component, demonstrating that site III is crucial for deocclusion and release of the first Na+ into the extracellular milieu (Moreno et al. 2022). The opening of ion channels in cardiomyocytes is regulated by the surface electric double layer of the cell membrane as revealed by studies with digoxin (Zhou et al. 2022). The effects of H2O2 on cys residues and other targets in the Na,K-ATPase have been discussed (Chkadua et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 3n23  PBDID: 4hyt  PBDID: 4xe5"},{"0":"3.A.3.1.2","1":"H+-, K+-ATPase (gastric; H+ efflux; K+ uptake).

A number of inhibitors of acid secretion have been identified, and these are of pharmacological importance (Shin et al. 2011). The catalytic alpha subunit has ten transmembrane segments with a cluster of intramembranal carboxylic amino acids located in the middle of TMSs 4, 5, 6 and 8. The beta subunit has one TMS with the N terminus in the cytoplasm. The extracellular domain of the beta subunit contains six or seven N-linked glycosylation sites.

Several 3-D structures are known (e.g., 3W5B). One has an ATP analogue, a Mg2+ and two Ca2+ ions in the respective binding sites (Toyoshima and Mizutani 2004). In this state, the ATP reorganizes the three cytoplasmic domains (A, N and P), which are widely separated without nucleotide, by directly bridging the N and P domains. The structure of the P-domain itself is altered by the binding of the ATP analogue and Mg2+. As a result, the A-domain is tilted so that one of the TMSs moves to lock the cytoplasmic gate of the transmembrane Ca2+-binding sites. This appears to be the mechanism for occluding the bound Ca2+ ions, before releasing them into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Toyoshima and Mizutani 2004). Molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence for the role of the Mg2+ and K+ bound states in the transport mechanism (Espinoza-Fonseca et al. 2014). Animal SERCAs are inhibited by three short single TMS membrane proteins, phospholamban (TC# 1.A.50.1), sarcolipin (1.A.50.2) and myoregulin (1.A.50.3), and the inhibitory actions of these peptides on SERCA are counteracted by a peptide called DWORF (Dwarf ORF) (Nelson et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2015). Norimatsu et al. 2017 have resolved the first layer of phospholipids surrounding the transmembrane helices. Phospholipids follow the movements of associated residues, causing local distortions and changes in thickness of the bilayer. The entire protein tilts during the reaction cycle, governed primarily by a belt of Trp residues, to minimize energy costs accompanying the large perpendicular movements of the transmembrane helices. A class of Arg residues extend their side chains through the cytoplasm to exploit phospholipids as anchors for conformational switching (Norimatsu et al. 2017). The human ortholog (O14983) is 96% identical to this rabbit enzyme. These enzymes are inhibited by the fungal mycotoxins, cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin (Darby et al. 2016; Houdou et al. 2019). The human ortholog is 97% identical and is of the same length. The SERCA residue Glu340 mediates interdomain communication that guides Ca2+ transport (Geurts et al. 2020). The SERCA Ca2+-ATPase may serve as a calcium-sensitive membrane-endoskeleton sensor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Nakamura et al. 2021). The C-terminal proton release pathway is a functional element of SERCA which provides a mechanistic model for its operation in the catalytic cycle of the pump (Espinoza-Fonseca 2021).","2":"PBDID: 1IWO  PBDID: 1KJU  PBDID: 1SU4  PBDID: 1T5S  PBDID: 1T5T  PBDID: 1VFP  PBDID: 1WPG  PBDID: 1XP5  PBDID: 2AGV  PBDID: 2BY4  PBDID: 2C88  PBDID: 2C8K  PBDID: 2C8L  PBDID: 2C9M  PBDID: 2DQS  PBDID: 2EAR  PBDID: 2EAT  PBDID: 2EAU  PBDID: 2O9J  PBDID: 2OA0  PBDID: 2VOY  PBDID: 2YFY  PBDID: 2ZBD  PBDID: 2ZBE  PBDID: 2ZBF  PBDID: 2ZBG  PBDID: 3AR2  PBDID: 3AR3  PBDID: 3AR4  PBDID: 3AR5  PBDID: 3AR6  PBDID: 3AR7  PBDID: 3AR8  PBDID: 3AR9  PBDID: 3B9B  PBDID: 3B9R  PBDID: 3BA6  PBDID: 3FGO  PBDID: 3FPB  PBDID: 3FPS  PBDID: 3J7T  PBDID: 3N5K  PBDID: 3N8G  PBDID: 3W5A  PBDID: 3W5B  PBDID: 3W5C  PBDID: 3W5D  PBDID: 4BEW  PBDID: 4H1W  PBDID: 4J2T  PBDID: 4KYT  PBDID: 4NAB  PBDID: 4UU0  PBDID: 4UU1  PBDID: 4XOU  PBDID: 4Y3U  PBDID: 4YCL  PBDID: 3tlm  PBDID: 4ycm  PBDID: 4YCN  PBDID: 5A3Q  PBDID: 5A3R  PBDID: 5A3S  PBDID: 5NCQ  PBDID: 5XA7  PBDID: 5XA8  PBDID: 5XA9  PBDID: 5XAA  PBDID: 5XAB  PBDID: 5ZMV  PBDID: 5ZMW  PBDID: 6HEF  PBDID: 6RB2  PBDID: 6YAA"},{"0":"3.A.3.2.7","1":"The sarco\/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, SERCA2b or ATP2A2, is encoded by the ATP2A2 gene. Mutatioins give rise to Darier''s disease; the spectrum of mutations have been related to patients' phenotypes (Ahn et al., 2003; Godic et al. 2010). SERCA1 functions as a heat generator in mitochondria of brown adipose tissue (de Meis et al., 2006). It normally functions as a Ca2+:H+ antiporter (Karjalainen et al., 2007). Capsaicin converts SERCA to a Ca2+ non-transporting ATPase that generates heat, and is thus a natural drug that augments uncoupled SERCA, resulting in thermogenesis (Mahmmoud, 2008b).\u00a0Oligomeric interactions of the N-terminus of sarcolipin with the Ca-ATPase have been documented (Autry et al., 2011), and these interactions also uncouple ATP hydrolysis from Ca2+ transport (Sahoo et al. 2015) resulting in thermogenesis. TMS 11, absent in SERCA1a and SERCA2a, functions in regulation (Gorski et al. 2012). The bovine SERCA has also been crystallized (2.9 \u00c5 resolution; Sacchetto et al., 2012). These enzymes are regulated differentially by phospholamban (PLN; 1.A.50.1.1) and sarcolipin (SLN; 1.A.50.2.1) as noted above (Gorski et al. 2013). SERCA2 is regulated by TMEM64 (9.B.27.5.1), a 380 aa 6 TMS membrane protein of the DedA family (TC# 9.B.27) which regulates Ca2+ oscillations by direct interaction with CIRCA2, modulating its activity and influencing osteoblast differentiation (Kim et al. 2013). Animal SERCAs are inhibited by three short single (C-terminal) TMS membrane proteins, phospholamban (TC# 1.A.50.1), sarcolipin (1.A.50.2) and myoregulin (1.A.50.3), and the inhibitory actions of these peptides on SERCA are counteracted by a peptide called DWORF (Dwarf ORF) (Nelson et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2015). Small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1; TC#8.A.28.1.2) and sarcolipin (TC# 1.A.50.2.1) interact in their transmembrane domains to regulate SERCA (Desmond et al. 2017). Reduced SERCA function preferentially affects Wnt signaling by retaining E-cadherin in the endoplasmic reticulum and promotes apoptosis (Suisse and Treisman 2019). There is strong coupling between the chronological order of deprotonation, the entry of water molecules into the TM region, and the opening of the cytoplasmic gate. Deprotonation of E309 and E771 is sequential with E309 being the first to lose the proton. Deprotonation promotes the opening of the cytoplasmic gate but leads to a productive gating transition only if it occurs after the transmembrane domain has reached an intermediate conformation (Rui et al. 2018). Coordination at cation binding sites I and II is optimized for Ca2+ and to a lesser extent for Mg2+ and K+ (Sun et al. 2019). Methyglyoxal reacts with and inhibits SERCA (Zizkova et al. 2018). The phospholamban pentamer alters the function of SERCA (Glaves et al. 2019). TMS11 followed by the luminal tail is inhibitory.\u00a0Inoue et al. 2019 determined the crystal structures of SERCA2b and its C-terminal splicing variant SERCA2a, both in the E1-2Ca2+-adenylylmethylenediphosphonate (AMPPCP) state. TMS11 is located adjacent to TMS10 and interacts weakly with a part of the L8\/9 loop as well as the N-terminal end of TMS10, thereby inhibiting the SERCA2b catalytic cycle (Inoue et al. 2019). Accordingly, mutational disruption of the interactions between TMS11 and its neighboring residues caused SERCA2b to display SERCA2a-like ATPase activity. The authors proposed that TMS11 serves as a key modulator of SERCA2b activity by fine-tuning the intramolecular interactions with other transmembrane regions. Kabashima et al. 2020 revealed what ATP binding does to the Ca2+ pump and how nonproductive phosphoryl transfer is prevented in the absence of Ca2+. They reported that the A-domain takes an E1 position, and the N-domain occupies exactly the same position as that in the E1.ATP.2Ca2+ state relative to the P-domain. As a result, ATP is properly delivered to the phosphorylation site. Yet phosphoryl transfer never takes place without filling the two transmembrane Ca2+-binding sites. This explains what ATP binding does to SERCA, and how nonproductive phosphorylation is prevented in E2 (Kabashima et al. 2020). Nonannular lipid binding is not necessary for the stability of the E2 state but may become functionally significant during the E2-to-E1 transition (Espinoza-Fonseca 2019). Structural changes induced by the binding of rutin arachidonate to SERCA1a may shift proton balance near the titrable residues Glu771 and Glu309 into neutral species, hence preventing the binding of calcium ions to the transmembrane binding sites and thus affecting calcium homeostasis (Rodr\u00edguez and M\u00e1jekov\u00e1 2020). SERCA2a is a key protein in the Ca2+ cycle during heart failure (Zhihao et al. 2020). Covalent conjugates of fullerene derivatives with xanthene dyes inhibit SERCA (Tatyanenko et al. 2020). Autophosphorylation of the pump with two bound Ca2+ ions triggers a large conformational change that opens a gate on the luminal side of the membrane allowing the release of the ions. In response to phosphorylation, the cytoplasmic domains are partially reconfigured into an intermediate state on the path toward the E2 state with a closed luminal gate (Thirman et al. 2021). In preB cells, loss of SERCA2 leads to reduced V(D)J recombination kinetics due to diminished RAG-mediated DNA cleavage (Chen et al. 2021). A series of structural changes may accompany the ordered dissociation of ADP, the A-domain rotation, and the rearrangement of the transmembrane (TM) helices. The luminal gate then opens to release Ca2+ toward the SR lumen. Intermediate structures on the pathway are stabilized by transient sidechain interactions between the A- and P-domains. Lipid molecules between TM helices play a key role in the stabilization (Kobayashi et al. 2021). Structural bases for the conformational and functional regulation of human SERCA2b have been reported (Zhang and Inaba 2022).","2":"PBDID: 5ZTF  PBDID: 6JJU  PBDID: 6LLE  PBDID: 6LLY  PBDID: 6LN5  PBDID: 6LN6  PBDID: 6LN7  PBDID: 6LN8  PBDID: 6LN9  PBDID: 7BT2"},{"0":"3.A.3.3.1","1":"H+-ATPase (efflux)","2":"PBDID: 1MHS"},{"0":"3.A.3.3.9","1":"Proton pumping ATPase, AHA2. 94% identical to AHA1 (3.A.3.3.7); generates the plasma membrane pmf.

Allosteric regulation by pH gradients modulates the switch between these states but not the pumping or leakage  rates (Veshaguri et al. 2016).

Modeling suggests that Cu+-binding sites HMBDs 5 and 6 are most important for function (Gourdon et al. 2012). ATP7B loads Cu+ into newly synthesized cupro-enzymes in the trans-Golgi network and exports excess copper out of cells by trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Mutations causing disease can affect activity, stability or trafficking (Braiterman et al. 2014). Cisplatin is a poor substrate relative to Cu+with a Km of 1 m\u03bcM, and copper and cisplatin compete with each other (Safaei et al. 2008).

In nonpolarized cells, the metal binding sites in the amino-terminal domain of MNK are required for copper-regulated trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (Greenough et al. 2004). It is expressed in Purkinje cells early in development and later in Bergmann glia. In melanocytes, it delivers Cu2+ to tyrosinase (Barnes et al., 2005). ATP7A has dual functions: 1) it incorporates copper into copper-dependent enzymes; and 2) it maintains intracellular copper levels by removing excess copper from the cytosol.

The KdpFABC acts as a functional and structural dimer with the two KdpB subunits in direct contact, but the enzyme can dissociate to the monomer (Heitkamp et al., 2008). KdpF is part of and stabilizes the KdpABC complex (Gassel et al., 1999). Transcription of the kdp operon is activated by the KdpDE sensor kinase\/response regulator pair, and unphosphorylated IIANtr of the PTS (TC# 4.A) binds KdpD to stimulate its activity, thereby enhancing kdp operon expression (L\u00fcttmann et al. 2009, L\u00fcttmann et al. 2015).

The structure reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits: a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites, and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. A mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active transport across biomembranes was proposed (Huang et al. 2017). The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of KdpD functions as a K+ sensor (Rothenb\u00fccher et al. 2006). Serine phosphorylated KdpB is trapped in a conformation where the ion-binding site is hydrated via an intracellular pathway between TMSs M1 and M2 which opens in response to the rearrangement of cytoplasmic domains, resulting from phosphorylation (Dubey et al. 2021).

In the cell membrane of erythrocytes, it is required to maintain phosphatidylserine (PS) in the inner leaflet preventing its exposure on the surface. This asymmetric distribution is critical for the survival of erythrocytes in circulation since externalized PS is a phagocytic signal for splenic macrophages (Arashiki et al. 2016).

Three structures were solved that represent the complex in an autoinhibited, an intermediate and a fully activated state. The analysis revealed sites of autoinhibition and PI4P-dependent activation. A putative lipid translocation pathway involves a conserved PISL motif in TMS 4 and polar residues of TMSs 2 and 5, in particular Lys1018, in the centre of the lipid bilayer (Timcenko et al. 2019). The enzymatic cycle of P-type ATPases is divided into autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation half-reactions. Unlike most other P-type ATPases, P4-ATPases transport their substrate during dephosphorylation only, i.e. the phosphorylation half-reaction is not associated with transport. To study the structural basis of the distinct mechanisms of P4-ATPases,\u00a0Timcenko et al. 2021 determined cryo-EM structures of Drs2p-Cdc50p covering multiple intermediates of the cycle. They identified several structural motifs specific to Drs2p and P4-ATPases in general that decrease movements and flexibility of domains as compared to other P-type ATPases. These motifs include the linkers that connect the transmembrane region to the actuator (A) domain, which is responsible for dephosphorylation. Mutation of Tyr380, which interacts with conserved Asp340 of the distinct DGET dephosphorylation loop of P4-ATPases, highlights a functional role of these P4-ATPase specific motifs in the A-domain. Finally, the transmembrane (TM) domain, responsible for transport, also undergoes less extensive conformational changes, which is ensured both by a longer segment connecting TM helix 4 with the phosphorylation site, and possible stabilization by the auxiliary subunit Cdc50p.

The sequential action of ESCRT-0, -I, and -II together with the ordered  assembly of ESCRT-III links membrane invagination to cargo sorting. Membrane scission in the neck of the growing vesicle releases mature, cargo-laden vesicles into the lumen (Buchkovich et al. 2013, Adell et al. 2014).  ESCRT-III is critical for late steps in MVB sorting, such as membrane invagination and final cargo sorting and recruitment of late-acting components of the sorting machinery (Adell et al. 2014).  SNF7 is the most abundant ESCRT-III subunit which forms membrane-sculpting filaments with 30\u00a0\u00c5 periodicity and a exposed cationic membrane-binding surface (Tang et al. 2015).  Its activation requires a prominent conformational rearrangement to expose protein-membrane and protein-protein interfaces. SNF7 filaments then form spirals that may function as spiral springs (Chiaruttini et al. 2015).  The elastic expansion of compressed SNF7 spirals generates an area difference between the two sides of the membrane and thus curvature, which could be the origin of membrane deformation leading eventually to fission.  SNF7 recruits BRO1, which in turn recruits DOA4, which deubiquitinates cargos before their enclosure within MVB vesicles (Amerik et al. 2000, Kim et al. 2005).  ESCRT-III is also recruited to the nuclear envelope (NE) by integral INM proteins to surveil and clear defective nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly intermediates to ensure the fidelity of NPC assembly (Webster et al. 2014).Vsp4 is an ATPase that provides the force generation and membrane scission by ESCRT-III (Sch\u00f6neberg et al. 2018). The sorting of transmembrane proteins (e.g., cell surface receptors) into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway to the lysosomal\/vacuolar lumen requires the function of the ESCRT protein complexes. The soluble coiled-coil-containing proteins Vps2, Vps20, Vps24, and Snf7 are recruited from the cytoplasm to endosomal membranes where they oligomerize into a protein complex, ESCRT-III. ESCRT-III contains two functionally distinct subcomplexes. The Vps20-Snf7 subcomplex binds to the endosomal membrane, in part via the myristoyl group of Vps20. The Vps2-Vps24 subcomplex binds to the Vps20-Snf7 complex and thereby serves  to recruit additional cofactors to this site of protein sorting. Evidence for a role for ESCRT-III in sorting and\/or concentration of MVB cargoes has been forthcoming (Babst et al. 2002). ESCRT-dependent protein sorting is required for the viability of yeast clathrin-mediated endocytosis mutants (Hoban et al. 2020). The ubiquitin hydrolase, Doa4, directly binds Snf7 to inhibit recruitment of ESCRT-III remodeling factors in S. cerevisiae (Buysse et al. 2020).

The majority of Crenarchaeota utilize the cell division system (Cdv) to divide. This system is encoded by three highly conserved genes, cdvA, cdvB and cdvC that are organized in an operon. The CdvA, CdvB and CdvC proteins polymerize between segregating nucleoids and persist throughout cell division, forming a successively smaller structure during constriction (Lind\u00e5s et al. 2008). CdvA is a membrane interacting protein that recruits ESCRT-III homologs to the membrane (Samson et al. 2011).CdvC is homologous to the AAA-type ATPase Vps4, involved in multivesicular body biogenesis in eukaryotes. CdvA is a unique archaeal protein that interacts with the membrane, while CdvB is homologous to the eukaryal Vps24 and forms helical filaments. Most Crenarcheota contain additional CdvB paralogs. In Sulfolobus acidocaldarius these are termed CdvB1-3. Yang and Driessen 2014 used a gene inactivation approach to determine the impact of these additional cdvB genes on cell division. Independent deletion mutants of these genes  were analyzed for growth and protein localization. One of the deletion strains (\u0394cdvB3) showed a severe growth defect on plates and delayed growth on liquid medium. It yielded the formation of enlarged cells and a  defect in DNA segregation. Since these defects are accompanied by an aberrant localization of CdvA and CdvB, it was concluded that CdvB3 fulfills an important accessory role in cell division.","2":"PBDID: 2W2U"},{"0":"3.A.4.1.1","1":"Arsenical resistance efflux pump (ATP-dependent)","2":"PBDID: 1F48  PBDID: 1IHU  PBDID: 1II0  PBDID: 1II9"},{"0":"3.A.5.1.1","1":"General secretory pathway (Sec-SRP) complex. A biphasic pulling force may act on TMSs during translocon-mediated membrane integration (Ismail et al. 2012). Intermediate structures for the insertion of integral membrane proteins have been visualized (Bischoff et al. 2014). Insertion of the Type II single span (N-terminus, in, C-terminus, out) protein, RodZ, requires only SecYEG, SecA and the pmf, but not SecB, SecDF, YidC or FtsY (Rawat et al. 2015). The combined effects of ribosome and peptide binding to SecYEG may allow for co-translational membrane insertion of successive transmembrane segments (Ge et al. 2014). SecA penetrates deeply into the SecYEG channel during insertion, contacting transmembrane helices and periplasmic loops (Banerjee et al. 2017). A partially inserted nascent chain unzips the Sec translocon's lateral gate (Kater et al. 2019). Cardiolipin (CL) is required in vivo for the stability of the bacterial translocon (SecYEG) as well as  its efficient function in co-translational insertion into and translocation across the inner membrane of E. coli (Ryabichko et al. 2020). PpiD (623 aas and 1 N-terminal TMS), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D, and YfgM (206 aas and 1 N-terminal TMS) facilitate the transport of toxins into the E. coli cell in a SecY-dependent process (Jones et al. 2021). Synchronized real-time measurement of Sec-mediated protein translocation has been described (Gupta et al. 2021). An extracellular cutinase from Amycolatopsis mediterranei (AmCut) is able to degrade the plastics, polycaprolactone and polybutylene succinate (Tan et al. 2022). It is secreted from E. coli using the Sec system for export across the inner membrane, and possibly, a non-classical secretion pathway for export across the outer membrane (Tan et al. 2022). The inner membrane YfgM-PpiD heterodimer, both proteins with N-terminal transmembrane segments and C-terminal periplasmic domains, acts as a functional unit that associates with the SecY\/E\/G translocon and promotes protein translocation (Miyazaki et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 2AKH  PBDID: 2AKI  PBDID: 3J45  PBDID: 3J46  PBDID: 5GAE  PBDID: 5MG3  PBDID: 5NCO  PBDID: 6R7L  PBDID: 2AKH  PBDID: 2AKI  PBDID: 3J45  PBDID: 3J46  PBDID: 5MG3  PBDID: 5NCO  PBDID: 2AKH  PBDID: 2AKI  PBDID: 3J45  PBDID: 3J46  PBDID: 5ABB  PBDID: 5GAE  PBDID: 5MG3  PBDID: 5NCO  PBDID: 6R7L  PBDID: 1DUL  PBDID: 1HQ1  PBDID: 2J28  PBDID: 2PXB  PBDID: 2PXD  PBDID: 2PXE  PBDID: 2PXF  PBDID: 2PXK  PBDID: 2PXL  PBDID: 2PXP  PBDID: 2PXQ  PBDID: 2PXT  PBDID: 2PXU  PBDID: 2PXV  PBDID: 3LQX  PBDID: 2XKV  PBDID: 2XXA  PBDID: 4C7O  PBDID: 5AKA  PBDID: 5GAD  PBDID: 5GAF  PBDID: 5GAG  PBDID: 5GAH  PBDID: 5NCO  PBDID: 1FTS  PBDID: 2QY9  PBDID: 2XXA  PBDID: 2YHS  PBDID: 3ZN8  PBDID: 4C7O  PBDID: 5GAD  PBDID: 5NCO  PBDID: 5NIY  PBDID: 6CQP  PBDID: 6CS8  PBDID: 6CVD  PBDID: 6DLX  PBDID: 6FPK  PBDID: 6FPR  PBDID: 6FQD  PBDID: 6N5I  PBDID: 6N5J  PBDID: 6N6N  PBDID: 6N9B  PBDID: 6NC1  PBDID: 6NC4  PBDID: 1TM6  PBDID: 2FSF  PBDID: 2FSG  PBDID: 2FSH  PBDID: 2FSI  PBDID: 2VDA  PBDID: 3BXZ  PBDID: 6GOX  PBDID: 2RDD"},{"0":"3.A.5.1.2","1":"SRP52\/SRP43\/FtsY of chloroplasts (SRP43 provides specificity to SRP52; crystal structures are known (Stengel et al., 2008).

The alpha-subunit (SecY) has two linked halves, transmembrane segments 1-5 and 6-10, clamped together by the gamma-subunit. A cytoplasmic funnel leading into the channel is plugged by a short helix. Plug displacement can open the channel into an 'hourglass' with a ring of hydrophobic residues at its constriction. This ring may form a seal around the translocating polypeptide, hindering the permeation of other molecules.

The Yet1 and Yet3 proteins interact directly with the Sec translocon (Wilson & Barlowe et al., 2010). The Sss1\/Sec61\u03b3 protein (80aas) has two domains. The cytosolic domain is required for Sec61p interaction while the transmembrane clamp domain is required to complete activation of the translocon after precursor targeting to Sec61p (Wilkinson et al., 2010). However, the apolar surfrace area determines the efficiency of translocon-mediated membrane-protein integration into the endoplasmic reticulum (\u00d6jemalm et al., 2011). The essential Sec62, Sec63 and non-essential Sec66 and Sec72 proteins may comprise an SRP-independent tetrameric translocon enlisting the lumenal chaperone, BiP\/Kar2 to \"\"ratchet\"\" its substrates into the ER (Feldheim and Schekman 1994; Ast et al. 2013). Cytosolic segments of the Sec61 complex important for promoting the structural transition between the closed and open conformations of the complex have been identified (Mandon et al. 2018). Positively charged residues in multiple cytosolic segments, as well as bulky hydrophobic residues in the L6\/7-TMS7 junction may be required for cotranslational translocation or integration of membrane proteins by the Sec61 complex (Mandon et al. 2018). The structure of the yeast post-translational Sec complex (Sec61-Sec63-Sec71-Sec72) by cryo-EM shows that Sec63 tightly associates with Sec61 through interactions in cytosolic, transmembrane, and ER-luminal domains, prying open Sec61's lateral gate and translocation pore, and thus activating the channel for substrate engagement. Sec63 optimally positions binding sites for cytosolic and luminal chaperones in the complex to enable efficient polypeptide translocation (Itskanov and Park 2019). Further, post-translational translocation is mediated by the association of the Sec61 channel with the membrane protein complex, the Sec62-Sec63 complex, and substrates move through the channel by the luminal BiP ATPase. Wu et al. 2019 determined the cryoEM structure of the S. cerevisiae Sec complex, consisting of the Sec61 channel and the Sec62, Sec63, Sec71 and Sec72 proteins. Sec63 causes wide opening of the lateral gate of the Sec61 channel, priming it for the passage of low-hydrophobicity signal sequences into the lipid phase, without displacing the channel's plug domain. Lateral channel opening is triggered by Sec63 interacting both with cytosolic loops in the C-terminal half of Sec61 and transmembrane segments in the N-terminal half of the Sec61 channel. The cytosolic Brl domain of Sec63 blocks ribosome binding to the channel and recruits Sec71 and Sec72, positioning them for the capture of polypeptides associated with cytosolic Hsp70. The structure thus shows how the Sec61 channel is activated for post-translational protein translocation (Wu et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 6N3Q  PBDID: 6ND1  PBDID: 6N3Q  PBDID: 6ND1  PBDID: 1NRJ  PBDID: 6N3Q  PBDID: 6ND1  PBDID: 2WW9  PBDID: 2WWA  PBDID: 6N3Q  PBDID: 6ND1  PBDID: 1NRJ  PBDID: 2GED  PBDID: 6N3Q  PBDID: 6ND1  PBDID: 6N3Q  PBDID: 6ND1  PBDID: 2WW9  PBDID: 2WWA"},{"0":"3.A.5.9.1","1":"Sec-SRP translocase complex. The BAP29 and BAP31 (also called BCAP31) proteins interact directly with the Sec translocon (Wilson & Barlowe et al., 2010). SRP68 and SRP72 form a complex with SRP RNA and SRP19. The SRP68 binding site for the RNA is a tetratricopeptide-like module that bends the RNA and inserts an arginine-rich helix into the major groove to open the conserved 5f RNA loop and remodel the RNA for protein translocation (Grotwinkel et al. 2014). Sec31 (Sec 31L1; HSPC334; HSPC275) is an outer cage component of the coat protein complex II (COPII) machinery which is recruited to specialized regions of the ER, called ER exit sites (ERES), where it plays a central role in the early secretory pathway. Sec31 also interacts with ALG-2 (Programed cell death protein 6 (PDCD6)) and annexin A11 (AnxA11) (Shibata et al. 2015). The Sec61 translocon mediates poorly efficient membrane insertion of Arg-containing TMSs, but a combination of arginine snorkeling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting is sufficient to lower the penalty of Arg insertion to an extent that a hydrophobic TMS with a central Arg residue readily inserts into a membrane (Ulmschneider et al. 2017). Mycolactone is a bacterium-derived macrolide that blocks the biogenesis of a large array of secretory and integral transmembrane proteins through potent inhibition of the Sec61 translocon (Morel et al. 2018). The Sec61\u03b1 subunit possesses an opening between TMS2b and TMS7, the lateral gate, that is the exit for signal sequences and TMSs of translocating polypeptides to the lipid bilayer (Kida and Sakaguchi 2018). BCAP31 (BAP31; 246 aas and 3 N-terminal TMSs) is an ER chaparone that plays a role in the export of secreted proteins in  the ER as well as the recognition of abnormally folded protein for targeting to the ER associated-degradation (ERAD) pathway (Wakana et al. 2008). It also serves as a cargo receptor for the export of transmembrane proteins (Annaert et al. 1997). Sec61 is the target of the cytotoxic plant-derived compound, ipomoeassin F (see TC family 8.C.10). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site for protein synthesis, folding, and maturation in eukaryotic cells, responsible for production of secretory proteins and most integral membrane proteins. The universally conserved protein-conducting channel Sec61 complex mediates core steps in these processes by translocating hydrophilic polypeptide segments of client proteins across the ER membrane and integrating hydrophobic transmembrane segments into the membrane. The Sec61 complex associates with several other molecular machines and enzymes to enable substrate engagement with the channel and coordination of protein translocation with translation, protein folding, and\/or post-translational modifications. Cryo-EM and functional studies have advanced our mechanistic understanding of Sec61-dependent protein biogenesis at the ER.\u00a0Itskanov and Park 2022 reviewed current models for how Sec61 performs its functions in coordination with partner complexes.

The ortholog of SpaQ in E. coli (SctS, of 86 aas and 2 TMSs like SpaQ) functions to ensures the fittings between the dynamic and static components of the T3SS (Tseytin et al. 2019). The Salmonella flagellar protein export machinery consists of a transmembrane export gate complex and a cytoplasmic ATPase complex. The gate complex has two intrinsic and distinct H+-driven and Na+-driven engines to drive the export of flagellar structural proteins (Minamino et al. 2021). Salmonella wild-type cells preferentially use the H+-driven engine under a variety of environmental conditions. The Na+-driven engine is activated by the interaction of the FlgN chaperone with FlhA when the ATPase complex is non-functional due to either of two single-residue substitutions in FlhA. Thus, it is likely that the FlgN-FlhA interaction generates a conformational change in FlhA that allows it to function as a Na+ channel. Minamino et al. 2021 proposed that this type of activation would be useful for flagellar construction under conditions in which the proton motive force is severely restricted. In enteropathogenic E. coli, assembly of the T3SS is initiated by the association of three proteins, SctR, SctS, and SctT, which create an entry portal to the translocation channel within the bacterial inner membrane. Using the T3SS,\u00a0Tseytin et al. 2022 investigated the role of two structural construction sites formed within the SctRST complex that are likely to act as seals, preventing leakage of ions and metabolites rather than as substrate gates. Two residues in SctS, Pro23, and Lys54, are critical for the proper activity of the T3SS.

The crystal structure of the IcmR-IcmQ complex has been solved (Raychaudhury et al., 2009). Legionella pneumophila survives and replicates inside host cells by secreting ~300 effectors through the defective in organelle trafficking (Dot)\/intracellular multiplication (Icm) type IVB secretion system (T4BSS). Ghosal et al. 2019, using electron cryotomography mapped the location of the core and accessory components of the Legionella core transmembrane subcomplex, revealing a well-ordered central channel that opens into a large, windowed secretion chamber with an unusual 13-fold symmetry. Immunofluorescence microscopy deciphered an early-stage assembly process that begins with the targeting of Dot\/Icm components to the bacterial poles. Polar targeting of this T4BSS is mediated by two Dot\/Icm proteins, DotU and IcmF, that are homologues of the T6SS membrane complex components TssL and TssM, suggesting that the Dot\/Icm T4BSS is a hybrid system. Thus, the Dot\/Icm complex assembles in an 'axial-to-peripheral' pattern (Ghosal et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 5X1E  PBDID: 5X90  PBDID: 5XNB  PBDID: 7BWK  PBDID: 3ADY  PBDID: 5X1H  PBDID: 5X42  PBDID: 6SZ9  PBDID: 5X1E  PBDID: 5X42  PBDID: 5X90  PBDID: 5XNB  PBDID: 6SZ9  PBDID: 7BWK  PBDID: 6EXA  PBDID: 6EXB  PBDID: 6EXC  PBDID: 6EXD  PBDID: 6EXE  PBDID: 6SZ9  PBDID: 3FXD  PBDID: 3FXE  PBDID: 4EYY  PBDID: 5X1E  PBDID: 5X90  PBDID: 7BWK"},{"0":"3.A.8.1.1","1":"Mitochondrial protein translocase (MPT) (Chacinska et al., 2005; Mokranjac et al., 2005; Bihlmaier et al., 2007). The crystal structure of the intermembrane space domain of yeast Tim50 has been solved to 1.83 \u00c5 resolution (Qian et al., 2011). A protruding beta-hairpin of Tim50 is crucial for interaction with Tim23, providing a molecular basis for the cooperation of Tim50 and Tim23 in preprotein translocation to the protein-conducting channel of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Qian et al., 2011). TIM23-mediates insertion of transmembrane \u03b1-helices into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Botelho et al., 2011). The TIM23 channel undergoes structural changes in response to the energized state of the membrane, the pmf (Malhotra et al. 2013). TMS1 in TIM23 is required for homodimerization while it and TMS2 are involved in pre-protein binding in the channel (Pareek et al. 2013). The Tom40 outer membrane channel may be a 19 \u03b2-stranded barrel, possibly homologous to the VDAC porins (TC# 1.B.8) (Lackey et al. 2014). Tim23 and Tim17 interact with each other as well as Tim44 and Pam17, respectively. These last two proteins may serve regulatory functions (Ting et al. 2014). Tom20, 22, 40 and 70 recognize presequences in various mitochondrially targetted proteins (Melin et al. 2015; Melin et al. 2014). In the 4 TMS TIM17 protein, mutations in TMSs1 and 2 impair the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, whereas mutations in TM3 compromise binding of the import motor (Demishtein-Zohary et al. 2017); further, residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor were identified. TIM22, forms an intramolecular disulfide bond in yeast and humans. If not oxidized, they do not properly integrate into the membrane complex, and the lack of Tim17 oxidation disrupts the TIM23 translocase complex (Wrobel et al. 2016). Mgr2 (TC# 1.A.111.1.3) and Pam18 are involved in precursormembrane protein quality control (Schendzielorz et al. 2018). Tom7 and OMA1 play reciprocal roles during mitochondrial import and activation of the PTEN-induced kinase 1, PINK1, in humans (Sekine et al. 2019). Organellar beta-barrel proteins are unique as most of them do not contain typical targeting information in the form of an N-terminal cleavable targeting signal. Instead, targeting and surface recognition of mitochondrial beta-barrel proteins in yeast, humans and plants depends on the hydrophobicity of the last beta-hairpin of the beta-barrel.\u00a0Klinger et al. 2019 demonstrated that hydrophobicity is not sufficient for the discrimination of targeting to chloroplasts or mitochondria. Using atVDAC1 (TC# 1.B.8.1.15) and psOEP24 (1.B.28.1.1) they showed that the presence of a hydrophilic amino acid at the C-terminus of the penultimate beta-strand is required for mitochondrial targeting. A mutation of the chloroplast beta-barrel protein psOEP24 which mimics such a profile is efficiently targeted to mitochondria (Klinger et al. 2019). The high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the core TOM complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in dimeric and tetrameric forms have been determined (Tucker and Park 2019).  Dimeric TOM consists of two copies each of five proteins arranged in two-fold symmetry: pore-forming beta-barrel protein Tom40 and four auxiliary alpha-helical transmembrane proteins. The pore of each Tom40 has an overall negatively charged inner surface due to multiple functionally important acidic patches. The tetrameric complex is a dimer of dimeric TOM, which may be capable of forming higher-order oligomers. Negatively charged residues in the N-terminus of Tim17 are critical for the preprotein-induced gating of the TIM23 translocase, possibly by recognizing the positive charges in the leader sequence of the substrate proteins (Meier et al. 2005). Tom22, Tom40 and Tom7 have been observed in primorial eukaryotes, arguing that these subunits were core to the complex early in evolution (Ma\u00c4\u0087asev et al. 2004). The assembly of the Tim22 complex have been studied () Kumar et al. 2020. The intermembrane space (IMS) and TMS4 regions of Tim22 are required for interactions with membrane-embedded subunits, including Tim54, Tim18, and Sdh3, and thereby maintain the functional architecture of the TIM22 translocase. The TMS1 and TMS2 regions of Tim22 are important for association with Tim18, whereas TMS3 is exclusively required for the interaction with Sdh3 (Kumar et al. 2020). TIM8.13 and TIM9.10 are chaparone proteins that form complexes, Tim23\/TIM8.13 and Tim23\/TIM9.10 complexes. TIM8.13 uses transient salt bridges to interact with the hydrophilic part of its client, but its interactions to the transmembrane part are weaker than in TIM9.10. Consequently, TIM9.10 outcompetes TIM8.13 in binding hydrophobic clients, while TIM8.13 is tuned to a few clients with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts (Su\u00c4\u008dec et al. 2020). The TOM complex is a multisubunit membrane protein complex consisting of a beta-barrel protein Tom40 and six alpha-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins, receptor subunits Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70, and regulatory subunits Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7 (Araiso et al. 2020). CryoEM structures showed a symmetric dimer containing five different subunits including Tom22. Different translocation paths within the Tom40 import channel seem to be present for different classes of translocating precursor proteins (Araiso et al. 2020). The Mgr2 subunit of the TIM23 complex regulates membrane insertion of marginal stop-transfer signals in the mitochondrial inner membrane (Lee et al. 2020). The architecture of the human TIM22 complex has been examined by chemical crosslinking (Valpadashi et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 3DXR  PBDID: 2GW1  PBDID: 6JNF  PBDID: 6UCU  PBDID: 6UCV  PBDID: 6JNF  PBDID: 6UCU  PBDID: 6UCV  PBDID: 2ZXT  PBDID: 3A3C  PBDID: 2GUZ  PBDID: 6JNF  PBDID: 6UCU  PBDID: 6UCV  PBDID: 2CIU  PBDID: 2MF7  PBDID: 6K7D  PBDID: 6K7E  PBDID: 6K7F  PBDID: 6K8Q  PBDID: 3CJH  PBDID: 6JNF  PBDID: 6UCU  PBDID: 6UCV  PBDID: 3CJH  PBDID: 6JNF  PBDID: 6UCU  PBDID: 6UCV  PBDID: 3DXR  PBDID: 2FXT  PBDID: 3QK9  PBDID: 4QQF  PBDID: 2GUZ"},{"0":"3.A.9.1.1","1":"Chloroplast envelope protein translocase (CEPT); outer membrane complex.

The complex I inhibitor metformin could be repurposed to inhibit TNF-induced mROS and necrosis in infected zebrafish and human macrophages, suggesting that this common  antidiabetes drug may also be a useful adjunct therapy for TB (Roca et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 4HE8  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 5B3P  PBDID: 5B3Q  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 4HE8  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 4HE8  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 4HE8  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 4HE8  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 4HE8  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 4HE8  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY  PBDID: 2FUG  PBDID: 2YBB  PBDID: 3I9V  PBDID: 3IAM  PBDID: 3IAS  PBDID: 3M9S  PBDID: 4HEA  PBDID: 6I0D  PBDID: 6I1P  PBDID: 6Q8O  PBDID: 6Q8W  PBDID: 6Q8X  PBDID: 6Y11  PBDID: 6ZIY  PBDID: 6ZJL  PBDID: 6ZJN  PBDID: 6ZJY"},{"0":"3.D.1.4.1","1":"Proton-translocating hydrogenase, H2ase","2":"PBDID: 6CFW  PBDID: 6CFW  PBDID: 6CFW  PBDID: 6CFW"},{"0":"3.D.1.6.1","1":"The vertebrate H+-translocating NADH dehydrogenase (NDH) complex (45 subunits) (Cardol et al., 2004).

The structures of many of the supernumerary subunits were determined or modeled. The structure provided insight into the roles of the supernumerary subunits in regulation, assembly and homeostasis. One such subunit, GRIM-19 or NDUFA13, (Q9P0J0 of the human homologue) is essential for membrane potential formation and NADH assembly (Lu and Cao 2008). Stroud et al. 2016 showed that 25 of the 31 accessory subunits in the 45 subunit human NADH dehydrogenase complex are required for assembly of a functional complex, and 1 subunit is essential for cell viability. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that loss of each subunit affects the stability of other subunits residing in the same structural module (Stroud et al. 2016).

The AppX protein of 30 aas and 1 TMS, is a paralogue of CydX and can substitute for it in activating the Cytochrome bd oxidase complex (VanOrsdel et al. 2013).

It has proton pumping activity, pumping 2  protons\/electron. Protons are probably pumped via D- and K-channels found in the cyoB subunit (Abramson et al. 2000). Two independent structures of the proton-pumping, respiratory cytochrome bo 3 ubiquinol oxidase (cytbo3) have been determined by cryo-EM in styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymer nanodiscs and in membrane scaffold protein (MSP) nanodiscs to 2.55- and 2.19-\u00c5 resolution, respectively (Li et al. 2021). The structures include the metal redox centers (heme b, heme o3 , and CuB), the redox-active cross-linked histidine-tyrosine cofactor, and the internal water molecules in the proton-conducting D channel. Each structure also contains one equivalent of ubiquinone-8 (UQ8) in the substrate binding site as well as several phospholipid molecules. The isoprene side chain of UQ8 is clamped within a hydrophobic groove in subunit I by TMS0, which is only present in quinol oxidases and not in the closely related cytochrome c oxidases. Both structures show carbonyl O1 of the UQ8 headgroup hydrogen bonded to D75(I) and R71(I). In both structures, residue H98(I) occupies two conformations. In conformation 1, H98(I) forms a hydrogen bond with carbonyl O4 of the UQ8 headgroup, but in conformation 2, the imidazole side chain of H98(I) has flipped to form a hydrogen bond with E14(I) at the N-terminal end of TMS0. The authors proposed that H98(I) dynamics facilitate proton transfer from ubiquinol to the periplasmic aqueous phase during oxidation of the substrate. Computational studies show that TMS0 creates a channel, allowing access of water to the ubiquinol headgroup and to H98(I) (Li et al. 2021).\u00a0Jose et al. 2021 investigated the key PM intermediate, which forms after O\u2013O bond cleavage and precedes proton pumping, using magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy.

Proton efflux occurs via a transient linear water-molecule chain in a hydrophobic section of the Brho channel between Asp96 and Asp85 (Freier et al., 2011). Local-global conformational coupling in brho has been proposed as a transport mechanism from crystal structures of the nine states in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle (Lanyi and Schobert 2004). The protein can be converted into a chloride uptake pump by a single amino acid substitution at position 85. However, halorhodopsin (3.E.1.2.1), which pumps chloride ions (Cl-) into the cell, apparently does not use hydrogen-bonded water molecules for Cl- transport (Muroda et al. 2012). Nango et al. 2016 used time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography and an x-ray free electron laser to visualize conformational changes in bRho from nanoseconds to milliseconds following photoactivation. An initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a conserved tryptophan residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic  side of the protein while dislodging a key water molecule on the extracellular side. The resulting cascade of structural changes throughout the protein shows how motions are choreographed as bRho transports protons uphill against a transmembrane concentration gradient.\u00a0Nango et al. 2016 have created a 3-d movie of structural changes in the protein showing that an initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a conserved tryptophan residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic side of the protein while dislodging a key water molecule on the extracellular side. Brho has light-independent lipid scramblase activity (Verch\u00e8re et al. 2017). This activity occurs at a rate >10,000 per trimer per second, comparable to that of other scramblases including bovine rhodopsin and fungal TMEM16 proteins. BR scrambles fluorescent analogues of common phospholipids but does not transport a glycosylated diphosphate isoprenoid lipid. In silico analyses suggested that membrane-exposed polar residues in transmembrane helices 1 and 2 of BR may provide the molecular basis for lipid translocation by coordinating the polar head-groups of transiting phospholipids. Consistent with this possibility, extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a BR trimer in a phospholipid membrane revealed water penetration along transmembrane helix 1 with the cooperation of a polar residue (Y147 in transmembrane helix 5) in the adjacent protomer. These findings suggest that the lipid translocation pathway may lie at or near the interface of the protomers of the BR trimer (Verch\u00e8re et al. 2017). Retinal isomerization has been observed in the using a femtosecond x-ray laser (Nogly et al. 2018). S-TGA-1, a halobacterium-derived glycolipid, has the highest specificity to bRho, with a nanomolar dissociation constant (Inada et al. 2019).\u00a0Weinert et al. 2019 recorded the structural changes in bacteriorhodopsin over 200 milliseconds in time. The snapshot from the first 5 milliseconds after photoactivation shows structural changes associated with proton release. From 10 to 15 milliseconds onwards, large additional structural rearrangements, up to 9\u00a0\u00c5 on  the cytoplasmic side. Rotation of leucine-93 and phenylalanine-219 opens a hydrophobic barrier, leading to the formation of a water chain connecting the intracellular aspartic acid-96 with the retinal Schiff base. The formation of this proton wire recharges the membrane pump with  a proton for the next cycle (Weinert et al. 2019). The effect of membrane composition on the orientation and activity of bR has been reported (Palanco et al. 2017). Efficient transfer of bRho from native membranes to covalently circularized nanodiscs has been accomplished (Yeh et al. 2018). The oligomeric status of BRho plays a role in the photocycle associated with short-range processes, such as retinal isomerization and deprotonation of the protonated Schiff base at the retinal pocket (Kao et al. 2019). Functional bacteriorhodopsin is efficiently solubilized and delivered to membranes by the chaperonin, GroEL (Deaton et al. 2004). Thirty one unfolded bR states in the presence of the retinal chromophore have been identified during denaturation (Jacobson et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 1AP9  PBDID: 1AT9  PBDID: 1BAC  PBDID: 1BAD  PBDID: 1BCT  PBDID: 1BHA  PBDID: 1BHB  PBDID: 1BM1  PBDID: 1BRD  PBDID: 1BRR  PBDID: 1BRX  PBDID: 1C3W  PBDID: 1C8R  PBDID: 1C8S  PBDID: 1CWQ  PBDID: 1DZE  PBDID: 1E0P  PBDID: 1F4Z  PBDID: 1F50  PBDID: 1FBB  PBDID: 1FBK  PBDID: 1IW6  PBDID: 1IW9  PBDID: 1IXF  PBDID: 1JV6  PBDID: 1JV7  PBDID: 1KG8  PBDID: 1KG9  PBDID: 1KGB  PBDID: 1KME  PBDID: 1L0M  PBDID: 1M0K  PBDID: 1M0L  PBDID: 1M0M  PBDID: 1MGY  PBDID: 1O0A  PBDID: 1P8H  PBDID: 1P8I  PBDID: 1P8U  PBDID: 1PXR  PBDID: 1PXS  PBDID: 1PY6  PBDID: 1Q5I  PBDID: 1Q5J  PBDID: 1QHJ  PBDID: 1QKO  PBDID: 1QKP  PBDID: 1QM8  PBDID: 1R2N  PBDID: 1R84  PBDID: 1S51  PBDID: 1S52  PBDID: 1S53  PBDID: 1S54  PBDID: 1S8J  PBDID: 1S8L  PBDID: 1TN0  PBDID: 1TN5  PBDID: 1UCQ  PBDID: 1VJM  PBDID: 1X0I  PBDID: 1X0K  PBDID: 1X0S  PBDID: 1XJI  PBDID: 2AT9  PBDID: 2BRD  PBDID: 2I1X  PBDID: 2I20  PBDID: 2I21  PBDID: 2NTU  PBDID: 2NTW  PBDID: 2ZFE  PBDID: 2ZZL  PBDID: 3COC  PBDID: 3COD  PBDID: 3HAN  PBDID: 3HAO  PBDID: 3HAP  PBDID: 3HAQ  PBDID: 3HAR  PBDID: 3HAS  PBDID: 2WJK  PBDID: 2WJL  PBDID: 3MBV  PBDID: 3NS0  PBDID: 3NSB  PBDID: 3T45  PBDID: 3UTV  PBDID: 3UTW  PBDID: 3UTX  PBDID: 3UTY  PBDID: 3VHZ  PBDID: 3VI0  PBDID: 4FPD  PBDID: 4HWL  PBDID: 4HYX  PBDID: 4MD1  PBDID: 4MD2  PBDID: 4OV0  PBDID: 4X31  PBDID: 4X32  PBDID: 4XXJ  PBDID: 5A44  PBDID: 5A45  PBDID: 4y9h  PBDID: 5j7a  PBDID: 5B34  PBDID: 5B6V  PBDID: 5B6W  PBDID: 5B6X  PBDID: 5B6Y  PBDID: 5B6Z  PBDID: 5BR2  PBDID: 5BR5  PBDID: 5H2H  PBDID: 5H2I  PBDID: 5H2J  PBDID: 5H2K  PBDID: 5H2L  PBDID: 5H2M  PBDID: 5H2N  PBDID: 5H2O  PBDID: 5H2P  PBDID: 5VN7  PBDID: 5VN9  PBDID: 5ZIL  PBDID: 5ZIM  PBDID: 5ZIN  PBDID: 6G7H  PBDID: 6G7I  PBDID: 6G7J  PBDID: 6G7K  PBDID: 6G7L  PBDID: 6GA1  PBDID: 6GA2  PBDID: 6GA3  PBDID: 6GA4  PBDID: 6GA5  PBDID: 6GA6  PBDID: 6GA7  PBDID: 6GA8  PBDID: 6GA9  PBDID: 6GAA  PBDID: 6GAB  PBDID: 6GAC  PBDID: 6GAD  PBDID: 6GAE  PBDID: 6GAF  PBDID: 6GAG  PBDID: 6GAH  PBDID: 6GAI  PBDID: 6RMK  PBDID: 6RNJ  PBDID: 6RPH  PBDID: 6RQO  PBDID: 6RQP"},{"0":"3.E.1.1.2","1":"Archaerhodopsin-2 (aR2) (a retinal protein-carotenoid complex) (Yoshimura and Kouyama, 2007).","2":"PBDID: 1VGO  PBDID: 2EI4  PBDID: 2Z55  PBDID: 3WQJ"},{"0":"3.E.1.1.3","1":"\"Middle\" rhodopsin or Brhol; has 11-cis-retinal and shows intermediate properties between Brho and sensory rhodopsin II (Sudo et al., 2011).

In cells suspended in a KCl solution, NaR functions as a light-driven proton pump, whereas in a NaCl solution, it exhibits light-driven sodium ion pumping, a novel activity within the rhodopsin family (da Silva et al. 2015). A cation switch controls its conformations, and specific interactions of Na+ with the half-channels open an appropriate path for ion translocation (da Silva et al. 2015). Several high resolution x-ray structures have been solved (4XTO, Kato et al. 2015).

The x-ray crystal structure revealed the presence of a putative binding site for a carotenoid antenna and a larger number of hydrophobic residues and aromatic-aromatic interactions than in most microbial rhodopsins (Tsukamoto et al. 2016). The structural changes upon thermal stimulation involved a thermally induced structure in which an increase of hydrophobic interactions in the extracellular domain, the movement of extracellular domains, the formation of a hydrogen bond, and the tilting of transmembrane helices were observed.

Replacing the glutamate located at the central gate of the ion channel with positively charged amino acyl residues reverses the ion selectivity and allows anion (chloride, Cl-) conduction (Zhang et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 3UG9"},{"0":"3.E.1.7.2","1":"Channelrhodopsin-2 (chlamyrhodopsin-4 of 737 aas and 7 N-terminal TMSs; ChR2; CR2; Cop4; CSOB) (light-gated cation-selective ion channel (both monovalent and divalent cations (H+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+) are transported)) (Nagel et al., 2003).\u00a0Berndt et al. (2010) showed that ChR2 has two open states with differing ion selectivities. The channel is fairly nonspecific at the beginning of a light pulse, and becomes more specific for protons during longer periods of light exposure. Residues involved in channel closure have been identified (Bamann et al. 2010). ChR2 is 712 aas long; the MR domain is N-terminal (Lee et al. 2015). The free energy profiles computed for proton transfer to the counterion, either via a direct jump or mediated by a water molecule, demonstrate that, when retinal is all-trans, water and protein electrostatic interactions largely favour the protonated retinal Schiff base state (Adam and Bondar 2018).  Blue light illumination of ChR2 activates an intrinsic leak channel conductive for cations. Sequence comparison of ChR2 with the related ChR1 protein revealed a cluster of charged amino acids within the predicted transmembrane domain 2 (TM2), which includes glutamates E90, E97 and E101. Charge inversion substitutions altered ChR2 function, replacement of E90 by lysine or alanine resulted in differential effects on H+- and Na+-mediated currents. These results are consistent with this glutamate side chain within TMS2 contributing to ion flux through and the cation selectivity of ChR2 (Ruffert et al., 2011).\u00a0Glutamate residue-97 lies in the outer pore where it interacts with a cation to facilitate dehydration. This residue is also the primary binding target of Gd3+(Tanimoto et al., 2012). Channelrhodopsin has been converted into a light-gated chloride channel (Wietek et al. 2014). TMSs 2, 6 and 7 reorient or rearrange during the photocycle with no major differences near TMSs 3 and 4 at the dimer interface. TMS2 plays a key role in light-induced channel opening and closing in ChR2 (M\u00fcller et al. 2015). Negative charges at the extracellular side of transmembrane domain 7 funnel cations into the pore (Richards and Dempski 2015). CrChR2, is the most widely used optogenetic tool in neuroscience. Water efflux and the cessation of the ion conductance are synchronized (L\u00f3renz-Fonfr\u00eda et al. 2015). light and pH induce changes in the structure and accessibility of TMSB (Volz et al. 2016). Residues V86, K93 and N258 form a putative barrier to ion translocation. These residues contribute to cation selectivity (V86 and N258), the transition between the two open states (V86), open channel stability, and the hydrogen-bonding network (K93I and K93N) (Richards and Dempski 2017). The x-ray structure is available and reveals much about the mechanism of channel regulation (Gerwert 2017; Volkov et al. 2017). The mechanism of formation of the ion channel of ChR2 has been studed by molecular dynamics simulation and steering (Yang et al. 2019). The effects on ion channel activities of different protonation states of E90 in channelrhodopsin-2 have been described (Cheng et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 3UG9  PBDID: 4YZI  PBDID: 6EID  PBDID: 6EIG"},{"0":"3.E.1.8.1","1":"Anion-specific light-gated channel rhodopsin of 438 aas, Acr1, lacking measurable cation transport capability (Govorunova et al. 2015).

The tunnel is the conductance channel closed by three constrictions: C1 in the extracellular half, mid-membrane C2 containing the photoactive site, and C3 on the cytoplasmic side. The crystal structure of bromide-bound GtACR1 revealed structural changes that relax the C1 and C3 constrictions, including a novel salt-bridge switch mechanism involving C1 and the photoactive site. Thus, substrate binding induces a transition from an inactivated state to a pre-activated state in the dark that facilitates channel opening by reducing free energy in the tunnel constrictions. The results provide direct evidence that the tunnel is the closed form of the channel of GtACR1 and shed light on the light-gated channel activation mechanism (Li et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 6CSM  PBDID: 6EDQ"},{"0":"3.E.2.1.1","1":"Photosynthetic reaction center (RC).

The system has been manipulated to engineer increased production of aromatic metabolites (Carmona et al. 2015, Vargas-Tah et al. 2015). The presence or absence of D-glucose reflects the transporter before and after release of the transported glucose into the cytoplasm. The transition associated with substrate release appears to require a subtle structural rearrangement in the region that includes hairpin 1 (Kalbermatter et al. 2017). Mlc (for makes large colonies) represses transcription of the genes encoding enzyme I, HPr, EIIBCGlc and EIIABCDMan in defined media that lack PTS  substrates. When glucose is present, the unphosphorylated form of EIIBCGlc sequesters Mlc to the cell membrane, preventing its interaction with DNA (Plumbridge 2002, Joyet et al. 2013). The Vibrio Mlc functions similarly (Pickering et al. 2014). A small (43 aa) protein, SgrT, acts in tandem with a well-characterized small RNA during metabolic stress, due to the accumulation of cytoplasmic sugar-Ps to help bacterial cells maintain balanced metabolism and continue  growing. SgrT acts on the glucose transport system, inhibiting its activity under stress conditions in order to allow cells to utilize alternative carbon sources (Lloyd et al. 2017). ptsG mRNA localization to the inner membrane, coupled with the membrane insertion of nascent peptide, mediates Hfq\/SgrS-dependent ptsG mRNA destabilization, presumably by reducing second rounds of translation (Kawamoto et al. 2005).

Conduction through MtrCAB directly to Fe(III) oxides occurs both in vitro in liposomes and in vivo, allowing anaerobic, solid-phase iron respiration (White et al. 2013). MtrC interacts with the surface of MtrAB, extending \u223c70 \u00c5 from the membrane surface and allowing the terminal hemes to interact with both MtrAB and  an extracellular acceptor. MtrA fully extends  through the length of MtrB, with \u223c30 \u00c5 being exposed into the periplasm. MtrCAB can reduce Fe(III) citrate with STC as an electron donor, disclosing a direct interaction between MtrCAB and STC (Edwards et al. 2018). MtrC, but not UndA (a paralog of MtrC of 843 aas; F8UWD6), appears to be the primary reductase of flavins to ensure fast indirect extracellular electron transfer (EET), which plays a crucial role in microbial fuel cell (MFC) electricity generation in Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 (Wu et al. 2018).

Their shapes suggest that MtrC interacts with the surface of MtrAB, extending approximately 70\u00a0\u00c5 from the membrane surface and allowing the terminal hemes to interact with both MtrAB and an extracellular acceptor. MtrA fully extends through the length of MtrB, with approximately 30 \u00c5 being exposed into the periplasm (Edwards et al. 2018).

TARP\u03b32 and TARP\u03b37 (8.A.16.2.5) can substitute for each other (Yamazaki et al. 2015). TARPs also enhance AMPAR function, altering ligand efficacy and receptor gating kinetics and shaping the postsynaptic response. Stargazin rescues gating deficiencies in AMPARs carrying mutations that destabilize the closed-cleft states of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), suggesting that stargazin stabilizes closed LBD states (MacLean et al. 2014). For Ca2+-permeable AMPARs, stargazin enhances receptor function by increasing single-channel conductance, slowing channel gating, increasing calcium permeability, and relieving the voltage-dependent block by endogenous intracellular polyamines (McGee et al. 2015). TARPs alter the conformations of pore-forming subunits and thereby affect antagonist interactions (Coki\u00c4\u0087 and Stein 2008). By shifting the balance between AMPAR activation and desensitization, TARPs markedly facilitate the transduction of spillover-mediated synaptic signaling (Coombs et al. 2017). Stargazin plays a role in AMPA receptor trafficking through the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway (Vandenberghe et al. 2005). Stargazin in complex with PSD-95 or PSD-95-assembled postsynaptic complexes form highly concentrated and dynamic condensates via phase separation, reminiscent of stargazin\/PSD-95-mediated AMPAR synaptic clustering and trapping (Zeng et al. 2019). Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of AMPA receptors boost cognitive performance in clinical studies, and mibampator and BIIB104 discriminate  between AMPARs complexed with distinct TARPs, and particularly those with lower stargazin\/gamma2 efficacy such as BIIB104 (Ishii et al. 2020). TARPs modulate receptor-mediated paired-pulse depression and recovery from desensitization (Devi et al. 2020). The influence of the TARP gamma8-selective negative allosteric modulator JNJ-55511118 on AMPA receptor gating and channel conductance has been studied (Coombs et al. 2022). Aberrant hippocampal transmission and behavior in mice with a stargazin mutation has been linked to intellectual disability (Caldeira et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 5kk2  PBDID: 6DLZ  PBDID: 6DM0  PBDID: 6DM1  PBDID: 6O9G"},{"0":"8.A.17.2.1","1":"Sodium channel \u03b22 subunit of 1040 aas and 1 or 2 TMSs, at the C-terminus and possibly at the N-terminus.

These PDZ proteins are normally abundant at apical membranes, where they tether membrane-delimited transporters. NHERF expression is particularly high at the apical membrane in polarized tissue such as intestinal, hepatic, and renal epithelial tissues (Walsh et al. 2015). DLG4 or PSD95 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of NMDA  receptor subunits and shaker-type potassium channels and is required for synaptic plasticity associated with NMDA receptor signaling. Overexpression or depletion of DLG4 changes the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, DLG4 may reduce the amplitude of ASIC3 acid-evoked currents by retaining the channel intracellularly. It also  regulates the intracellular trafficking of ADR1B and controls AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) immobilization at postsynaptic density, keeping the channels in an activated state in the presence of glutamate and preventing synaptic depression. This involves palmitoylation (Jeyifous et al. 2016). Stargazin in complex with PSD-95 or PSD-95-assembled postsynaptic complexes forms highly concentrated and dynamic condensates via phase separation, reminiscent of stargazin\/PSD-95-mediated AMPAR synaptic clustering and trapping (Zeng et al. 2019). AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission is well established. PSD-95 captures AMPARs via an interaction with the AMPAR auxiliary subunits-transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs).

Junctin is a transmembrane protein of striated muscles, located at the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It is characterized by a luminal C-terminal tail, through which it functionally interacts with calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). In non-muscle cells, junctin and calsequestrin assemble in long linear regions within the endoplasmic reticulum, mirroring the formation of calsequestrin polymers (Rossi et al. 2022). In differentiating myotubes, the two proteins colocalize at triads, where they assemble with other proteins of the junctional SR. Two KEKE motifs can bind calsequestrin, and stretches of charged amino acids downstream of these motifs can also bind calsequestrin and the RyR.

Human duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with the inhibition  of calcium uniport in mitochondria and an increased sensitivity of the organelles to the calcium-induced permeability transition (Dubinin et al. 2020). Cardiac mitochondria exhibit higher calcium retention capacity and higher rates of calcium uptake during sleep periods. This is associated with higher expression of clock gene Bmal1, lower expression of per2, greater expression of MICU1 gene (mitochondrial calcium uptake 1), and lower expression of the mitochondrial transition pore regulator gene cyclophilin D. Protein levels of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), MICU2, and sodium\/calcium exchanger (NCLX) were also higher at sleep onset relative to wake periods. While complex I and II-dependent oxygen utilization and the transmembrane potential of cardiac mitochondria were lower during sleep, ROS production was increased, presumably due to mitochondrial calcium sequestration. Thus, retaining mitochondrial calcium in the heart during sleep dissipates the membrane potential, slows respiratory activities, and increases ROS levels, which may contribute to increased vulnerability to cardiac stress during the sleep-wake transition. This pronounced daily oscillations in mitochondrial functions pertaining to stress vulnerability may at least in part explain diurnal prevalence of cardiac pathologies.","2":"PBDID: 4NSC  PBDID: 4NSD  PBDID: 6K7Y  PBDID: 6LB7  PBDID: 6LB8  PBDID: 6LE5  PBDID: 6WDN  PBDID: 6WDO  PBDID: 6XJV  PBDID: 6XJX  PBDID: 6XQN  PBDID: 6XQO"},{"0":"8.A.44.1.2","1":"The EF-hand-containing calcium-binding protein of the calcium uniporter, MICU2 or EFHA1 of 434 aas.

ADAM10 is docked to junctions by its transmembrane partner Tspan33, whose cytoplasmic C-terminus binds to the WW domain of PLEKHA7 in the presence of PDZD11. ADAM10 is locked at junctions through binding of its cytoplasmic C-terminus to afadin. Junctionally clustered ADAM10 supports the efficient formation of stable toxin pores. Instead, disruption of the PLEKHA7-PDZD11 complex inhibits ADAM10 and toxin junctional clustering. This promotes toxin pore removal from the cell surface through an actin- and macropinocytosis-dependent process, resulting in cell recovery from initial injury and survival (Shah et al. 2018). Shear stress activates ADAM10 sheddase to regulate Notch1 via the Piezo1 force sensor in endothelial cells (Caolo et al. 2020).","2":"PBDID: 6BDZ  PBDID: 6BE6"},{"0":"8.A.77.1.6","1":"Ats1 or ADAMTS1 of 967 aas.

ATP6AP2 is necessary for cell division, cell cycle progression and mitosis, and it inhibits ciliogenesis, thus promoting proliferation and preventing differentiation (Wanka et al. 2017). It is an assembly factor in the endoplasmic reticulum for the V-type ATPase (Guida et al. 2018). It forms a complex with ATP6AP1 (Q15904; 470 aas, two TMSs, N- and C-terminal), also called ATP6S1 and VATPS1. It has roles in various physiological processes, such as the cell cycle, autophagy, acid-base balance, energy metabolism, embryonic development, T cell homeostasis, water balance, blood pressure regulation, cardiac remodelling and maintenance of podocyte structure. These roles of the (P)RR are mediated by its effects on important biological systems and pathways including the tissue RAS, vacuolar H+-ATPase. It may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as fibrosis, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, diabetic microangiopathy, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity (Ichihara and Yatabe 2019). PRR or ATP6AP2 is a type I transmembrane receptor that is capable of binding and activating prorenin and renin. Within the kidney, PRR is predominantly expressed in the distal nephron, particularly the intercalated cells, and activation of renal PRR contributes to renal injury in various rodent models of chronic kidney disease. Evidence has shwon that PRR is primarily cleaved by a site-1 protease to produce 28-kDa soluble PRR (sPRR) which seems to mediate most of the known pathophysiological functions of renal PRR through modulating the activity of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and provoking proinflammatory and profibrotic responses.

Photoreceptor required for image-forming vision at low light intensity. Light-induced isomerization of 11-cis to all-trans retinal  triggers a conformational change leading to G-protein activation and release of all-trans retinal. The tetraspanning peripherin-2 (TC# 8.A.40.1.2) links rhodopsin to a cyclic nucleotide-dependent channel (TC# 1.A.1.5.3) in the outer segments of rod photoreceptors. The G266D retinitis pigmentosa mutation  in TMS4 of rhodopsin abolishes binding of peripherin-2 and prevents association with the CNGA1\/CNGB1a subunits present in the complex (Becirovic et al. 2014). A channel through opsin, responsible for the passage of retinal from and to its central site where it forms a Schiff's base with a lysine in TMS7 has been proposed (Hildebrand et al. 2009).\u00a0Blankenship et al. 2015 presented the 2.3-A resolution structure of native source rhodopsin stabilized in a conformation competent for G protein binding. An extensive water-mediated hydrogen bond network linking the chromophore binding site to the site of G protein binding was observed, providing connections to conserved motifs essential for GPCR activation. Both Opsin and Rhodopsin serve as phospholipid flippases (scramblases) and thus have been implicated in photoreceptor disc membrane homeostasis (Menon et al. 2011; Goren et al. 2014; Ernst and Menon 2015; Wang et al. 2018). One particular conformation of rhodopsin is an open channel connecting the ligand binding site with the membrane and the intradiscal lumen of rod outer segments. Sufficient in size, the passageway permits the exchange of hydrophobic ligands such as retinal (Mattle et al. 2018). G protein-coupled receptors such as rhodopsin interact with hydrophobic ligands that probably enter their binding pockets through transmembrane pores (Tian et al. 2022).","2":"PBDID: 4ZWJ  PBDID: 5DGY  PBDID: 5W0P  PBDID: 6CMO"},{"0":"9.A.14.1.3","1":"Melatonin receptor type 1A, or MT1 of 350 aas and 7 TMSs.

The cryoEM structure of SMO bound to Patched reveals that SMO has a channel open to the membrane as well as to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). This domain, like that in Patched, is large enough to accomodate cholesterol, so SMO could be a transporter as well as a receptor (Sommer and Lemmon 2018; Qi et al. 2018). Sterols in an intramolecular channel of Smoothened mediate Hedgehog signaling (Qi et al. 2020). SMO, a class Frizzled G protein-coupled receptor (class F GPCR), transduces the Hedgehog signal across the cell membrane. Sterols can bind to its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and to several sites in the seven transmembrane helices (7 TMSs) of SMO.\u00a0Qi et al. 2020 determined the structures of SMO-Gi complexes bound to the synthetic SMO agonist (SAG) and to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24(S),25-EC).

Additional structures of two gain-of-function variants, SMO(D384R) and SMO(G111C\/I496C), showed that blocking the channel at its midpoints allows sterols to occupy the binding sites in 7-TMSs, thereby activating SMO. Thus, sterol transport through the core of SMO is a major regulator of SMO-mediated signaling. These observations shows that like other 7 TMS GPCRs, SMO is capable of transport, in this case, transporting cholesterol (Qi et al. 2020).

Different levels of autophagy activity reflect differences in autophagosome formation, correlating with the delivery of Atg9 to the PAS. Phosphorylation regulates the Atg9 interaction with Atg23 and Atg27 (Feng et al. 2016). Atg27 is required for Atg9 cycling, and shuttles between the pre-autophagosomal structure, mitochondria, and the Golgi complex (Yen et al. 2007). Atg9 colocalizes with Atg2 at the expanding edge of the isolation membrane (IM), where Atg2 receives phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Matoba et al. 2020 reported that yeast and human Atg9 are lipid scramblases that translocate phospholipids between outer and inner leaflets of liposomes in vitro. Cryo-EM of fission yeast Atg9 revealed a homotrimer, with two connected pores forming a path between the two membrane leaflets: one pore, located at a protomer, opens laterally to the cytoplasmic leaflet; the other, at the trimer center, traverses the membrane vertically. Mutation of residues lining the pores impaired IM expansion and autophagy activity in yeast and abolished Atg9's ability to transport phospholipids between liposome leaflets. Thus, phospholipids delivered by Atg2 are translocated from the cytoplasmic to the luminal leaflet by Atg9, thereby driving autophagosomal membrane expansion. Guardia et al. 2020 solved a high-resolution cryoEM structure of the ubiquitously expressed human ATG9A isoform. ATG9A is a domain-swapped homotrimer with a unique fold, and has an internal network of branched cavities. The functional importance of the cavity-lining residues which could serve as conduits for transport of hydrophilic moieties, such as lipid headgroups, across the bilayer has been suggested (Guardia et al. 2020). Transbilayer phospholipid movement that is mediated by Atg9 is involved in the biogenesis of autophagosomes (Orii et al. 2021).","2":"PBDID: 6VZF  PBDID: 6KBM  PBDID: 6KBN  PBDID: 6KYB"},{"0":"9.A.15.2.1","1":"The autophagy protein complex. The molecular mechanisms of autophagy have been reviewed (Hurley and Young 2017; Dupont et al. 2017). Autophagy is related to apoptosis and autoimmunity (Song et al. 2017; Wu and Adamopoulos 2017). It is an intracellular degradation process carried out by a double-membrane organelle, termed the autophagosome (Molino et al. 2017). Three proteins (TM9SF1 (TC#8.A.68.1.13), TMEM166 (listed here) and TMEM74 (TC# 9.B.189.2.1)) regulate autophagosome formation (He et al. 2009). The generation of Atg9 vesicles from a Rab11-positive reservoir is tightly controlled by the Bif-1-DNM2 membrane fission machinery in response to cellular demand for autophagy. ATG9A is essential for multiple steps of epithelial tight junction biogenesis and actin cytoskeletal regulation (Dowdell et al. 2020). Autophagy involves capture of cytoplasmic materials into double-membraned autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation of the materials by lysosomal hydrolases. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human ATG9A isoform at 2.9-\u00c5 resolution has been solved (Guardia et al. 2020). The structure reveals a fold with a homotrimeric domain-swapped architecture, multiple membrane spans, and a network of branched cavities, consistent with ATG9A being a membrane transporter. Mutational analyses support a role for the cavities in the function of ATG9A. Structure-guided molecular simulations predict that ATG9A causes membrane bending, explaining the localization of this protein to small vesicles and highly curved edges of growing autophagosomes (Guardia et al. 2020). The mechanism of Atg9 recruitment by Atg11 in the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway has been examined (Coudevylle et al. 2022). Autophagosomes form de novo, but how is poorly understood.  Particularly enigmatic are autophagy-related protein 9 (Atg9)-containing vesicles that are required for autophagy machinery assembly but do not supply the bulk of the autophagosomal membrane.\u00a0Sawa-Makarska et al. 2020 reconstituted autophagosome nucleation using recombinant components from yeast. They found that Atg9 proteoliposomes first recruited the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase complex, followed by Atg21, the Atg2-Atg18 lipid transfer complex, and the E3-like Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex, which promoted Atg8 lipidation. They found that Atg2 could transfer lipids for Atg8 lipidation. In selective autophagy, these reactions could potentially be coupled to cargo via Atg19-Atg11-Atg9 interactions. They proposed that Atg9 vesicles form seeds that establish membrane contact sites to initiate lipid transfer from compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum (Sawa-Makarska et al. 2020). Drosophila Atg9 regulates the actin cytoskeleton via interactions with profilin and Ena (Kiss et al. 2020). RUSC2 and WDR47 oppositely regulate kinesin-1-dependent distribution of ATG9A to the cell periphery (Guardia et al. 2021).

Tapasin (TAPA, TABBP, NGS17 of 448 aas) is a necessary accessory protein for proper presentation of peptide antigens (Sadegh-Nasseri et al. 2008). A charged amino acyl residue in the transmembrane\/cytoplasmic region of tapasin influences MHC class I assembly and maturation (Petersen et al. 2005). The human specific poxvirus molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) has developed robust immune evasion strategies (Harvey et al. 2019). MCV-encoded MC80 can disrupt MHC-I antigen presentation in human and mouse cells. MC80 shares moderate sequence-similarity with MHC-I, and it associates with components of the peptide-loading complex. Expression of MC80 results in ER-retention of host MHC-I and thereby reduced cell surface presentation. MC80 accomplishes this by engaging tapasin via its luminal domain, targeting it for ubiquitination and ER-associated degradation in a process dependent on the MC80 transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. Tapasin degradation is accompanied by a loss of TAP, which limits MHC-I access to cytosolic peptides (Harvey et al. 2019).","2":"PBDID: 1AKJ  PBDID: 1AO7  PBDID: 1AQD  PBDID: 1B0G  PBDID: 1B0R  PBDID:

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways and are vesicle coat components that appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (Nakatsu and Ohno 2003). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (Owen et al. 2004). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components; AP2 directly regulates PAR1 trafficking, (Paing et al. 2006). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes, which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes, are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing to CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI]  endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway (Lau and Chou 2008). During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (Marcello et al. 2013).  The AP-2 mu subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins and recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs. The surface region interacting with the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at 'Tyr-156' in membrane-associated AP-2 (Partlow et al. 2019).

It is a leukocyte differentiation antigen and adhesin of 472 aas protein with 2 TMSs, one N-terminal and one C-terminal (Schwenk et al. 2010). Studies have shown that TMS 1 plays a role in formation of a homodimeric structure which may be involved in regulating signal transduction (Wei et al. 2017). Uptake of long chain unsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, is facilitated by CD36\/SR-B2 (Glatz and Luiken 2017). Glycosylation, ubiquitination and palmitoylation are involved in regulating CD36 stability, while phosphorylation at extracellular sites affects the rate of fatty acid uptake (Luiken et al. 2016). CD36 may facilitate fatty acid uptake by an indirect mechanism (Jay and Hamilton 2016), but fatty acid uptake studies in breast cancer cells is consistent with its role in transport (Zhao et al. 2017). CD36 is also a co-receptor that enhances the response to MICs of Toxoplasma gondii (Costa Mendon\u00e7a-Natividade et al. 2019). CD36 is expressed in multiple cell types, mediates lipid uptake, immunological recognition, inflammation, molecular adhesion, and apoptosis. CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that contains several posttranslational modification sites and binds to diverse ligands, including apoptotic cells, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and fatty acids (FAs) (Wang and Li 2019).

In the kidney, it mediates the tubular uptake and clearance of leptin, and transports leptin across the blood-brain barrier through endocytosis at the choroid  plexus epithelium. Endocytosis of leptin in neuronal cells is required for hypothalamic leptin signaling and leptin-mediated regulation of feeding and body weight. It also mediates endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation of CST3 in kidney proximal tubule cells, and catalyzes renal uptake of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in complex with the vitamin D3 transporter GC\/DBP. It is also involved in the renal uptake of metallothionein-bound heavy metals (Klassen et al. 2004).  Together with CUBN, it mediates renal reabsorption of myoglobin as well as renal uptake and subsequent lysosomal degradation of APOM while playing a role in kidney selenium homeostasis by facilitating renal endocytosis of selenoprotein SEPP1.

This protein contains a large domain that is homologous to several proteins in TC family 9.A.63. Al-Akhrass et al. 2021 investigated a bidirectional relationship between HER2-HER3 signaling and SorLA. They showed that heregulin-mediated signaling supports SorLA transcription downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and that SorLA interacts directly with HER3, forming a trimeric complex with HER2 and HER3 to attenuate lysosomal degradation of the dimer in a Ras-related protein Rab4-dependent manner. In line with a role for SorLA in supporting the stability of the HER2 and HER3 receptors, loss of SorLA compromised heregulin-induced cell proliferation (Al-Akhrass et al. 2021). NMR resonance assignments of the transmembrane domain of LR11\/SorLA in E. coli membranes has been reported (Ding et al. 2020).

The carboxy-terminal peptide regions of the teneurins plays a role in neuronal function and behavior in mammals (Hogg et al. 2019). LPH1 is presynaptic, whereas Lasso, its high affinity ligand, is postsynaptic. A C-terminal fragment of Lasso interacts with LPH1 and induces Ca2+ signals in presynaptic boutons of hippocampal neurons and in neuroblastoma cells expressing LPH1.

Inhibition of endothelial cell migration by thrombospondin-1 type-1 repeats is mediated by beta1 integrins (Short et al. 2005). Integrin beta1 interacts with integrins \u03b11 - 11 to form receptors for fibronectin, laminin, several bacteria and viruses and many other extracellular proteins, and it facilitates sperm-egg fusion (Paul et al. 2015). It forms a tight complex with CD98hc (TC# 8.A.9.2.2) and TrpV4 (TC# 1.A.4.2.5) in focal adhesions where mechanochemical conversion takes place. CD98hc knock down inhibits TRPV4-mediated calcium influx induced by mechanical forces, but not by chemical activators, thus confirming the mechanospecificity of this signaling response. Molecular analysis revealed that forces applied to beta1 integrin must be transmitted from its cytoplasmic C-terminus via the CD98hc cytoplasmic tail to the ankyrin repeat domain of TRPV4 in order to produce ultra-rapid, force-induced, channel activation within the focal adhesion (Potla et al. 2020).
